The unprecedented destruction stands as a testament to the devastating power of this new weapon, which is feared not only for what it can do to its targets, but what implications it has for the one who deploys it and for humanity itself.\n\nThe world holds its breath waiting for what will come next. Will this force [From.From.Owner.GetName] to surrender to avoid further terror, or will it only strengthen their resolve to strike back against those who would resort to such measures?"

ABY_Event.1.t:0 "Colourful Egg Nation Tip"
ABY_Event.1.d:0 "Dear Traveller, the first Egg Nation from the Otherworld has now appeared on the continent of Teyvat. Due to Paradox Development Studio's wise code design, an evil force from beyond the heavens will continue to eat away at your archive. It's a force similar to the Sumeru Deadlands, or the Black Mud of the Laminar Rock Giant Abyss, and its spread will crash your game. So, please do not let this happen, Dear Traveller. Also, try not to let the computer AI manipulate the egg countries. P-Society designed a set of AI logic for the original nations, but this logic is not adapted to the Tivat world. Lastly, the content of the Egg Nation originates from the design of P. We merely arrange a resolution to release the Egg Nation. As for the egg countries being released, some conflicts or problems may arise, for example, France has a resolution to dismantle the Macedonian defense line, but there is no Macedonian defense line in the world of Tivat. We cannot be responsible for these problems. Our main job is to design nations and powers in the Proto-God worldview. I am very sorry for this, please bear with us."

ABY_News.5.d:0 "Recently, a huge fleet led by the Seven Dusty Nations of Tivat conducted a massive military exercise in the Sea of Yunlai. The exercise was aimed at strengthening the security of the entire Tivat and improving communication between the armies of the nations. It was reported that the exercise involved a total of tens of thousands of troops from the sea and air, including the most advanced weaponry and military technology from each country. The content of the exercise included maritime navigation, air support, island landing, combating the strongholds of the Chukchans and other aspects, which comprehensively demonstrated the strength and level of the armies of various countries. The holding of the exercise further highlights the close cooperation and coordination among the seven earthly nations in the field of maritime security, and also conveys to the outside world the firm determination of the seven earthly nations to maintain regional peace and security."
