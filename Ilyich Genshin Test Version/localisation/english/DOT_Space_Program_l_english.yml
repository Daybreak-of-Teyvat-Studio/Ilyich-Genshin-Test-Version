DOT_Space_Program_decisions:0 "Illuminating project"
DOT_Space_Program_decisions_desc:0 "Project Qiming is a grand plan to explore the world above the sky. In the thousands of years since the beginning of human civilization, we have never broken through the false sky set by the original God. It is a barrier that separates Tiwat from the abyss and a cage that limits human vision. The history of the Seven Earthly Kingdoms is filled with war and suffering, and the spike's existence is a punishment for mankind's endless longing. However, we should not give up the exploration of the unknown. We should use the power of science and technology to build aircraft that can pass through the false sky and realize the dream of mankind. According to the theoretical model of Zhdanov Tsiolkovsky, a scholar of the winter, we may be able to achieve enough speed and altitude through the design of multistage rockets to break through the shackled false sky and gain new hope. Tiwat is the cradle of mankind, but mankind cannot be bound to the cradle forever. Enlightening is our first step to a new world."
DOT_Space_Program_decisions_01:0 "Start revealing the plan"
DOT_Space_Program_decisions_01_desc:0 "Start the project: Our goal is to build a ship that can fly through false skies and a kit that can survive in extreme conditions. We will draw on the resources and talents of every region to achieve this feat. We believe that only in this way can we uncover the truth about Tiwat and confront the enemies who are trying to stop us."
DOT_Space_Program_decisions_02:0 "Building space bases"
DOT_Space_Program_decisions_02_desc:0 "In order to carry out the Qiming project, we first need to build an aerospace base. In this way, we can launch our spacecraft, explore the mysteries of the universe, and search for new resources and civilizations. We are determined to break free from the bonds of the keepers of nature and become the true masters of Tivat. We will not yield to any outside threat or interference, and we will use our wisdom and courage to create our future."

DOT_Space_Program.1.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]The government announced that we were determined to use our technology and magic to prepare to launch exploration rockets into space, in order to understand the reality of the world, free from the constraints of the virtual world. We're not content to just live in a world controlled by gods. We want to explore the wider universe and find our own destiny. To achieve this goal, we are determined to spend decades of time and energy building a huge rocket launch pad and a rocket that can withstand extreme conditions to complete our program."

DOT_Space_Program.2.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]The government announced that we had finished building a space base for space exploration. Our space base is deep in the mountains and has advanced rocket and satellite technology. Our goal is to explore the mysteries of the universe and search for life and resources on other planets. We hope to bring new knowledge and opportunities to the Tiwat continent through space exploration. We believe that the world beyond the false sky is full of hidden wisdom and secrets waiting to be discovered."

DOT_Space_Program.3.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]The government regrets to inform you that our first space experiment did not achieve the expected success. We used a multistage space rocket, but something went wrong during liftoff, causing the rocket to explode at an altitude of about eight kilometers and not reach its intended orbit. The failure of this experiment brought a heavy setback to our Qiming program and made us realize our shortcomings in space technology."

DOT_Space_Program.4.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]The government announced that after a long time of preparation, we carried out the second space rocket launch plan. The first half of the launch went smoothly, with the massive thrust lifting the rocket to an altitude of 10,000 meters. But when the rocket is about to pass over an altitude of 644, 800 meters at the sky island, a red light suddenly jet out of the sky island, shot down our space rocket. We watched in horror as the rocket exploded in the air, scattering debris. We couldn't believe what we were seeing, and we couldn't accept what was happening. We could only stare angrily at the sky Island, no doubt, this is a shameless sneak attack!"

DOT_Space_Program.5.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]The government announced that after reviewing the lessons learned from the failure of the last program, we decided to launch 18 space rockets simultaneously in response to the surprise attack of the Sky Island. In the end, three of the rocket products escaped the blockade of the Sky Island, only to be stopped by the strange sky dome. Our rockets could not penetrate that seemingly weak layer of air, and had no choice but to crash into the dark ocean. Although the operation did not achieve the desired results, it also provided us with valuable information and experience. We will not give up the exploration of heaven, we believe that one day we will uncover its truth."

It was the first time in human history to break through the sky, and the first time to send life into outer space. Our cats will be there to explore unknown mysteries and bring us back valuable data and experience."

DOT_Space_Program.7.d:0 "[ROOT.GetNameWithFlag]The government declared the fifth space experiment a historic achievement, which showed the courage and wisdom of human beings to explore unknown areas. We succeeded in sending three brave astronauts out into the world, where they carried out important scientific experiments and observations. Unfortunately, we also suffered a great loss, two astronauts lost their lives in the recovery of the rocket, they gave their lives for this great cause. We express our deep condolences and respect to their families and the entire nation, and we will always remember their service and sacrifice."
