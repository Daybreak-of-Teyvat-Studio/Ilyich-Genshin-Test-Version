AND_support_Bennett_1_desc:0 "§RTo implement this decision, Bennett's influence needs to exceed 2 points.§!\n In order to ensure that refugees who have already arrived and are about to come to the Wolvendom can have adequate food and clothes, we will send Bennett to organize production activities for the refugees. We will use our own hands to strive for a comfortable life."
AND_support_Bennett_2_desc:0 "§RTo implement this decision, Bennett's influence needs to exceed 3 points.\n Additionally, this will give Bennett 1 point of influence.§!\nBennett's vision and his past life experience enabled him to assist in the construction of many facilities, such as canals and tunnels. His extraordinary strength also allowed him to move heavy objects that ordinary people could not lift. Seeing Bennett's activity, the residents of the Wolvendom must also have a good impression of him."
AND_support_Bennett_3_desc:0 "§RThis will give Bennett 1 point of influence!§!\nIn past production activities, Bennett has gained widespread trust among grassroots people. Now we will send him as a representative to distribute the food we have stored and purchased from the outside to the people of the Wolvendom to stabilize their hearts, and Bennett's reputation will also become better as a result."
AND_support_Fischl_1_desc:0 "§RTo implement this decision, Fischl's influence needs to exceed 2 points.\n Additionally, this will give Fischl 1 point of influence.§!\nAlthough her academic literacy is not high, Fischl has outstanding talent and vision, always finding the key to academic breakthroughs in the first place. If we had her help, some of our academic research could have made rapid progress."
AND_support_Fischl_2_desc:0 "§RTo implement this decision, Fischl's influence needs to exceed 3 points.\n Additionally, this will give Fischl 1 point of influence.§!\nMiss Fischl has always advocated the use of advanced technology to reduce resource waste and improve production efficiency. In her opinion, it is precisely because Wolvendom lacks human and material resources that it is more appropriate to use more advanced technology early. Now we will send her to supervise the implementation of new technologies and provide guidance and support to prevent our production from stopping progress due to concerns about risks or unwillingness to step out of the comfort zone. The achievements brought about by new technology will inevitably be known to the public, and Fischl will also receive more praise for it."
AND_support_Fischl_3_desc:0 "§RThis will give Fischl 1 point of influence!§!\n As the leader of the superstructure structure of our administrative agency, Fischl has always been regarded as the most senior administrator of our interim government, although she seems unwilling to spend time on it. Now, we will put into practice some of her previously unfulfilled theories and transform our government agencies to better meet the needs of the people. As the proposer of reform, Fischl's credibility will also increase."
AND_support_Diona_1_desc:0 "§RTo implement this decision, Diona's influence needs to exceed 2 points.§!\n Compared to the other leaders of the Wolvendom, Diona, who was once a well-known bartender, is better at socializing and understands the importance of maintaining good relationships with various social groups. Now we will dispatch her to negotiate with newly formed groups in the Wolvendom - from trade unions, to farmers' associations, collective enterprises, emerging chambers of commerce, and civil armed forces - while cooperating, we will exercise a certain degree of control over these individuals to ensure stability and security within the Wolvendom."
AND_support_Diona_2_desc:0 "§RTo implement this decision, Diona's influence needs to exceed 3 points.\n This will give Diona 1 point of influence!§!\nDiona, from Springvale, has been engaged in coordinating various production and commercial activities since arriving at Wolvendom. Therefore, she has become more aware of the importance of infrastructure - it is the lifeblood system for our survival, connecting our various production links. Now, through fundraising and government funding, we are ready to implement her infrastructure construction plan, and Diona's reputation will also increase as a result."
AND_support_Diona_3_desc:0 "§RThis will give Diona 1 point of influence!§!\nDue to the size of our government, it is impossible for us to fully control every production of the increasingly large Wolvendom. As a result, commerce emerged from the cracks in our control and demonstrated astonishing vitality. We have also found that some projects are very difficult to implement by the government, but it would be very simple to entrust them to emerging businessmen, and our cooperation with these businessmen has also emerged as a result. At least so far, these commercial activities have been beneficial to the people of Wolvendom. In order to better benefit Wolvendom, we will implement a preferential policy for business development, which will be implemented by Miss Diona, who has more extensive contact with businessmen."
AND_support_Razor_1_desc:0 "§RThis decision requires the influence of all three others to be less than 5 points.§!\n Since the establishment of our army, they have been fighting - perhaps against enemies, perhaps against beasts, perhaps against the treacherous nature. During the battle, many problems of our army were exposed, and many new tactical innovations were born. As the leader of the army, Razor summarized these problems and experiences one by one and will improve them."
AND_support_Razor_2_desc:0 "§RThis decision requires the influence of all three others to be less than 5 points.\n Additionally , this will reduce 1 influence point of other three candidates!§!\nThe external crisis is approaching, and in order to ensure peace in the possible war, we will continue to organize a self-defense army, which requires weapons. Razor will come forward to raise weapons and train troops, and his agile skills and running figure will be remembered by the people of Wolvendom."
AND_support_Razor_3_desc:0 "§RThis will reduce 1 influence point of other three candidates.§!\nPhysically arming our team is not enough to achieve victory. We also need to mentally arm our troops, arm our people, and first make them believe that we can win, so that they can contribute sweat and blood to this goal. Razor will conduct a military parade within the Wolvendom, showcasing our determination and strength to protect ourselves to the public."
AND_oppose_Bennett_1_desc:0"§RTo implement this decision, Bennett's influence needs to exceed 3 points.\n Additionally, this will take away Bennett 1 point of influence.§!\nBennett's enthusiasm and diligence made most people willing to listen to his words, rather than just treating them as fortune cookie comments, as they usually do with our propaganda. Now, we will send Bennett to give a speech to boost the morale of the people. This is undoubtedly an action that benefits the collective led by Wolvendom, but it may also be consuming Bennett's good reputation."
AND_oppose_Bennett_2_desc:0"§RTo implement this decision, Bennett's influence needs to exceed 3 points.\n Additionally, this will take away Bennett 1 point of influence.§!\nBennett's enthusiasm and diligence are evident to everyone, and the people often see him as a "neighborhood big brother" rather than a senior bureaucrats in the government - in Teyvat, which senior bureaucrat would carry building materials everywhere and teach people how to farm? This also gave him a certain appeal. Now, we will send Bennett to call on everyone to engage in voluntary labor and work for our tomorrow. This is undoubtedly an action that benefits the collective led by Wolvendom, but it may also be consuming Bennett's good reputation."
AND_oppose_Fischl_1_desc:0"§RTo implement this decision, Fischl's influence needs to exceed 3 points.\n Additionally, this will take away Fischl 1 point of influence.§!\nThe Wolvendom, which has continuous influx of refugees, has countless affairs to deal with every day, but the government we just founded lacks the conventional administrative ability to quickly resolve them. Now, we will let Fischl take the lead in working overtime and mobilize all administrative personnel to work overtime to address the issues we need to address and implement our predetermined policies. Miss Fischl, who keeps working overtime, may naturally diminish her influence in the outside world due to reduced exposure."
AND_oppose_Fischl_2_desc:0"§RTo implement this decision, Fischl's influence needs to exceed 3 points.\n Additionally, this will take away Fischl 1 point of influence.§!\nNow we have seen the enormous power of goodwill from the outside world, thanks in part to the main executor of external propaganda, Fischl. Now, we will make her continue to work hard, continue to expand our publicity and fundraising, and receive more material assistance from the outside world! As long as we don't stop working overtime, our material reserves will continue to increase! So, don't stop working overtime!"
AND_oppose_Diona_1_desc:0"§RTo implement this decision, Diona's influence needs to exceed 3 points.\n Additionally, this will take away Diona 1 point of influence.§!\n Obviously, not everyone in this world is an angel, and now there are more and more troublemakers and even sinister conspiracy groups plotting to overthrow us within Wolvendom. In order to prevent them from disrupting the peace and stability of the Wolvendom, we will take action in advance and strike hard to let them know the strength and determination of our interim government. This operation will be led by Diona, who said she will act with the determination to destroy the Mondstadt wine industry... However, Fischl hopes she has a different determination. Some chambers of commerce seem to have doubts about our actions, but this is something that cannot be avoided."
AND_oppose_Diona_2_desc:0"§RTo implement this decision, Diona's influence needs to exceed 3 points.\nAdditionally, this will take away Diona 1 point of influence.§!\nAs the leader of Springvale, surrounded by numerous warlords, Diona is well aware of the importance of armaments. Following her suggestion, we have started preparing to expand our military production. Some people say that Diona's actions are "disrupting the free market," but if we cannot defend the Wolvendom, there will be neither freedom nor market here, only destruction left."
AND_oppose_Razor_1_desc:0"§RThis decision requires the influence of all three others to be less than 5 points.§!\n Razor, who grew up with the interim government of Wolvendom, is well aware of the importance of consultation and exchange. With his efforts, we will hold a democratic consultation conference to promote multi-party cooperation, coordinate the development of the entire Wolvendom, and ultimately achieve our common goals."
AND_oppose_Razor_2_desc:0"§RThis decision requires the influence of all three others to be less than 3 points.\n Additionally, this will give each of them 1 point of influence.§!\n Defending the Wolvendom not only requires an army, but also an economic system that operates for war. Now, Razor will exert his influence to defend the Wolvendom, prepare weapons, and accelerate economic mobilization. It is obviously very painful to have the newly settled residents of the Wolvendom to do this, but we have to do it."
