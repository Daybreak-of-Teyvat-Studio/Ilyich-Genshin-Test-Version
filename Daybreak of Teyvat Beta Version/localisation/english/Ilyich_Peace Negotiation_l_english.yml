Ilyich_Peace_Treaties_03_t: “Love Each Other”
Ilyich_Peace_Treaties_03_d: “Your two countries have had longstanding diplomatic relations, and in order to show our friendship, we will send our craftsmen and workers to help build your country with the finest weapons and materials. We will choose the most beautiful place and build a military factory in the dangerous pass, where we can cast guns and steel armor. Choose the fertile soil, set up civilian factories in the thoroughfares, spinning machines and weaving cloth, smelting iron and casting plows, in order to promote all kinds of industries, and to build up wealth and goods. The two countries will work together to share the peace and prosperity.”
Ilyich_Peace_Treaties_03_DESC: “Your two countries have longstanding diplomatic relations, and as a sign of friendship, we will send craftsmen and laborers to assist in the construction of your state with fine equipment and materials. We will choose the most beautiful place and build a military factory in the dangerous pass, where we can cast guns and steel armor. Choose the fertile soil, set up civilian factories in the thoroughfares, spinning machines and weaving cloth, smelting iron and casting plows, in order to promote all kinds of industries, and to build up wealth and goods.

ILYICH_PEACE_TREATIES_03_TITLE: “Love Each Other”
ILYICH_PEACE_TREATIES_03_ACTION_DESC: “As the saying goes, it is better to teach a man to fish than to teach him to fish. Your and my two countries, long time diplomatic relations, in order to show friendship, we will send special craftsmen and workers, lose the fine equipment and good materials, to assist in the construction of your state. Military importance, the first in self-improvement, so choose the place of victory, building military factories in the dangerous passes, can be cast guns, can be refined steel armor, make sure that the armature is sophisticated, ammunition and equipment is sufficient. Civilian benefits, valuable in commerce, choose another fertile soil, set up civilian factories in the thoroughfares, spinning and weaving, smelting iron and casting ploughs, as well as learning the secret of the chemical industry, in order to promote the industry, in order to build up the wealth of goods. The two countries are in agreement, the military and industry, so that we can share the peace and prosperity, the same as the Kang Fu. (If the AI's favorability towards a country is higher than 90, the AI's tendency to aid that country will be increased.) \n\n§G The aided country will be given 1 military factory and 1 civilian factory. §! \n§R The aided country will lose 100 Manpower & 1000 Rifles. §!”
