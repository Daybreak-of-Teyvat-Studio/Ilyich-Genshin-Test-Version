 Columbina:"Columbina"
 Columbina_desc:"Columbina was the Third of the Eleven Fatui Harbingers, a group of influential and powerful individuals who acted as the chief lieutenants of the Tsaritsa of Snezhnaya. Codenamed "Damselette," she was an enigmatic woman who inspired weariness in even her fellow Harbingers. She seemingly retired from the Fatui and returned to her birthplace, Nod-Krai, and hid herself in Hiisi Island, where she was worshipped as the patron deity (possibly an Archon herself) of the Frostmoon Scions."
