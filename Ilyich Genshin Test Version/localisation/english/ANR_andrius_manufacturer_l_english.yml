simple_bicycle_workshop_desc:0 "The founder of Cecilian Bicycle Workshop was originally just a group of craftsmen who discovered the travel needs of the people of Wolvendom. After inventing the great two wheeled transportation tool, bicycles, their products received praise throughout Wolvendom, and even the army of Wolvendom began to purchase this transportation tool for complex terrain traffic. Nowadays, people riding bicycles with the Cecilia logo can be seen everywhere on the grasslands of the Wolvendom."
andrius_truck_desc:0 "This truck factory was born due to the need for production collaboration and exchange of resources among various villages in Wolvendom. The trucks coming out of this factory burn resins, connecting the industrial chain of Wolvendom and bringing fresh vegetables, fruits, aquatic products, and exquisite consumer goods to various parts of Wolvendom. However if the storm of war had come to Wolvendom, they will have a new responsibility: to provide vital needs, weapons, and ammunition to soldiers on the frontline, and to support those brave warriors who defend their homes. Perhaps there will also be motorized equipment transformed from the Andrius truck factory, driven by soldiers and galloping behind the enemy." 
mond_peoples_truck_maunufacturer_desc:0 "The People's Tractor Production Group of Mondstadt sprouted from the tractor repair workshop established by the government. As it approached the unification war, it was finally able to independently produce tractors without relying on the outside world, allowing workers in the fields to sweat less and improving the efficiency of construction sites. After the unification of Mondstadt, this tractor production enterprise received government praise and further funding, and was tasked with producing a powerful weapon that deterred the enemy."
andrius_tank_trust_desc:0 "After a series of dazzling operations, several tractor and armament manufacturers formed a coalition to monopolize the raw materials, technology, and equipment for tractor and armor production, and to some extent, cut corners to achieve extremely low production costs, thereby defeating competitors, monopolizing these goods, and profiting excessively."
fishery_association_desc:0 "With the increase of Wolvendom’s population, the gathering industry has gradually been unable to meet people's food needs. Many people who were originally engaged in fishing have returned to their old business and established the Fisheries Association of Cider Lake to provide fresh lake fish for the new residents of the Wolvendom. It is said that a young man who had never fished before performed excellently among them. After the establishment of this association, some residents, though lived far from water, claimed that their current intake of fish and meat had reached ten times of before."
mond_peoples_ship_maunufacturer_desc:0 "People's Shipbuilding Group of Mondstadt, formerly known as Cider Lake Shipyard, was originally a state-owned enterprise that produced fishing boats for the fishermen of Wolvendom. In the Mondstadt Unification War, many fishermen were attacked by the enemy at sea, and the Cider Lake Shipyard began to produce ships capable of fighting on the lake to a limited extent. After the unification of Mondstadt, this shipyard was expanded and invested, attempting to build warships that could sail on the sea, chopping waves and exploring the future for Mondstadt's people."
andrius_ship_trust_desc:0 "This group was originally just an unknown small shipyard, established during the Wolvendom period and belonging to the public sector. During the period of government decentralization, the leader of the enterprise deliberately dragged down the production of the factory, which was considered a non-performing asset by the originally good performing shipyard and privatized. This person was able to buy the shipyard at an extremely low costs and suppress the opposing workers with strict rules. After the war of unification, this powerful man never stopped expanding, and annexed countless similar enterprises with a series of legal or undiscovered means. Finally, he completely monopolized this industry, known as trust. Now, this group can serve us and create a usable fleet at low cost."
mond_peoples_aircraft_maunufacturer_desc:0 "People's Aviation Group of Mondstadt is a state-owned enterprise that was born after the unification war, whose backbone is researchers who study captured enemy fighter jets during the unification war. After the unification of Mondstadt, the enterprise grew through exploration and learning, attracting countless elite talents who returned from abroad. It studied many ancient Mondstadt books and various existing flight devices, such as the Jade Chamber of Liyue and the cultivator of Khaenri'ah, and was able to manufacture an increasing variety of aircraft. Nowadays, airplanes produced by this group can be seen at airports across Mondstadt, and this group has become our main supplier to the air force"

andrius_blacksmith_shop_desc:0 "Uncle Wagner, after being driven away from Mondstadt City by the flames of war, arrived at the Wolvendom. Unable to spare any time, he decided to teach his craft to more people, so there was a new Wagner's blacksmith shop. The residents used the weapons made by him and his disciples to drive away wild animals and protect crops, and that sentence also spread throughout the mountains of the Wolvendom\"No defective goods under Wagner's craftsmanship!\""
mond_peoples_infantry_weapon_maunufacturer_desc:0 "The People's Munitions Group of Mondstadt was initially just a group of small, united workshops. During the period of the Self-Defense War, the government began large-scale procurement of military supplies, leading to the rise of many military production enterprises. These enterprises - the enterprises that later formed the quartermaster group are basically collectively owned enterprises, which are independent of government management, responsible for their own profits and losses, and implement democracy internally. The salaries of managers, technicians, and production personnel are similar. During the period of the unification war, these enterprises had already reached a certain scale. Faced with the fierce war situation and a vision of peace, the members of these enterprises decided after consultation that the production of the general should be handed over to the government for management, so that the products could support the soldiers on the front line as quickly as possible, allowing peace to return to Mondstadt faster. Today, despite the unification of Mondstadt, this group still maintains its original intention and works for Mondstadt’s safety."

construction_union_of_wolfendom_desc:0 "The temporary construction team of Wolvendom was born out of the growing housing needs of refugees. It is said that even Mr. Bennett once worked there as an ordinary worker. Nowadays, this construction team has become heroic in the mind of the people in Wolvendom. The size of this team is expanding every day, and their presence can be seen anywhere in the Wolvendom."
mond_peoples_cons_and_reas_maunufacturer_desc:0 "The People's Construction and Research Group of Mondstadt used to have two names, one was the \"Wolvendom Temporary Construction Team\" and the other was the \"Wolvendom Scientific Research Institution\". After Mondstadt's unification, these two facilities were integrated to achieve rapid utilization of research results for production."
AND_cons_and_reas_konzern_desc:0 "After the decentralization of the government, a massive and spanning konzern was born, and it grew every moment. It now has its own school, providing itself talented researchers; The largest research institute in Mondstadt provides it with intelligence and endeauvors; There are also astonishing scale production units, with a daunting number of construction teams, negotiators, and legal advisors, achieving monopolies in multiple industries. But this konzern also has its own concerns: as its scale expands, corruption has begun to breed. The stable benefits brought by monopolies also prevent them from trying risky new technologies and product improvements."
