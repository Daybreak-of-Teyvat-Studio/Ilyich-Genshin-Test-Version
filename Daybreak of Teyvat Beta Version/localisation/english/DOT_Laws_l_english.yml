Elementary_Education_desc:0 "History recognizes great men who are ennobled by their work for a common purpose; Experience praises those who bring happiness to most people as the happiest; Religion itself teaches us that the ideal man we all admire has sacrificed himself for humanity - and who can deny such teaching? If we choose the profession which labors most for the welfare of mankind, then the burden cannot overwhelm us, because it is for the common sacrifice; Then we will not feel a poor, limited, selfish pleasure; our happiness will belong to millions; our cause will live on silently but eternally, and noble men will shed tears over our ashes."

DOT_Industry:0 "Level of industrial development" # industry
DOT_Government_Industry1:0 "The bud of industrialization"
DOT_Government_Industry1_desc:0 "This force has almost no industrialization to speak of, most of the complex production depends on craftsmen, and the social supply and demand situation is still in the stage of short supply."
DOT_Government_Industry2:0 "Preliminary industrialization"
DOT_Government_Industry2_desc:0 "With the support of the technology leaked by Midwinter and Fontaine, this force has set up factories from which a steady stream of goods is produced, However, such production is often slowed down or even interrupted by the lack of raw material input and purchasing power due to the small scale of influential industries and incomplete production types."
DOT_Government_Industry3:0 "Through the industrial chain"
DOT_Government_Industry3_desc:0 "upported by the technology leaked by Midwinter and Fontaine, the industry of this force is booming, from raw materials to industrial products and back to raw materials and means of production, the vast industrial machine is like the tricarboxylic acid cycle of eukaryotic cells. To provide the indispensable fuel for the functioning of society. But the boom has room to grow."
DOT_Government_Industry4:0 "Prosperity Industry Chain"
DOT_Government_Industry4_desc:0 "The industry of this power is so developed that it produces goods beyond the purchasing power of the common people. For ordinary people here, it is taken for granted that complex industrial products can be bought in the shops near their homes. Young people here can no longer imagine a life of deprivation, and many of them yearn for the "good life without industrial production."
DOT_Government_Industry5:0 "The Dawn of Industry"
DOT_Government_Industry5_desc:0 ""Father, why do foreigners want to make a fire because they are afraid of the cold?" This is the horizon of Tiwat, from where the first glow of Tiwat dawn begins to shine to the whole world. §! Here, the most advanced production techniques of the Tiwat continent are applied, and all kinds of industrial products are like organs in the body, which accompany a person from birth. So much wealth was produced in the factories that even the country itself could not keep up, and the excess wealth flowed like spilled chocolate to the whole of Tiwat, and even the people of the neighboring countries praised the great system of production for this sweet chocolate."
# Agriculture
DOT_Agriculture:0 "Level of agricultural development"
DOT_Government_Agri1:0 "Fly the earth for meat"
DOT_Government_Agri1_desc:0 ""Broken bamboo, continued bamboo, flying earth, meat." There is almost no agriculture here, and most food production depends on fishing and hunting led by the Eye holders. This method of production, while providing a large amount of protein, cannot feed a large enough population, let alone support an industrial civilization."
DOT_Government_Agri2:0 "Slash-and-burn"
DOT_Government_Agri2_desc:0 ""If you can't feed yourself with the skin of a lycoris elm, you can't feed yourself with slash-and-burn." The agricultural technology in this area is relatively backward, and can not even catch up with the usual villages in Tiwat, and even the "soil method" to increase land fertility is not known, and "migration agriculture" is often used for agricultural production. Such production is not only extremely hard, but also takes up a lot of manpower."
DOT_Government_Agri3:0 "Pastoral"
DOT_Government_Agri3_desc:0 "The small peasant economy is the most common and natural form of agricultural organization in Tivat, and their hard work is the basis of all happiness on this land. Farmers who farm under this organization are less able to resist risks and are therefore reluctant to experiment with advanced technologies. Although Tiwat already has advanced technologies to boost agricultural production, such as grass fertilizer, most farmers here do not have access to it - and many have not even heard of it."
DOT_Government_Agri4:0 "Intensive farm"
DOT_Government_Agri4_desc:0 ""Papa, look, it's the Wings of Wind! " "Get out of the way, he's spraying pesticide!" The extensive use of grass fertilizers and magic tractors has brought far greater efficiency to agriculture in this region than in other countries, and with this advanced technology is an advanced form of agricultural organization. Whether it is large farm production or some kind of cooperative, advanced agricultural production organizations have become an important part of the economy here. Advanced agriculture freed a large number of people from agricultural production and enabled them to engage in more advanced industries such as industry and research, further accelerating social progress."
DOT_Government_Agri5:0 "The Dawn of Agriculture"
DOT_Government_Agri5_desc:0 ""Daddy, foreigners don't have food, why don't they eat cake?" This is the horizon of Tiwat, from where the first glow of Tiwat dawn begins to shine to the whole world. §! Here, advanced agricultural techniques unimaginable in other countries and overly radical methods of agricultural organization have been applied, and extremely efficient agriculture and industry support each other, lifting this society to the top of the world. People here don't worry about hunger, they worry about being out of shape. Shops began to advertise "natural pollution-free products" with "soul," attracting many soul-eating monsters to buy them."

DOT_Government_Army2:0 "Barely made an army."
DOT_Government_Army3:0 "Organized"
DOT_Government_Army4:0 "The Army of a Hundred Wars"
DOT_Government_Army5:0 "Steel Discipline"
DOT_Government_Army5_desc:0 "§Y The same as "One Heart" "Let the noblest anger roll like waves!" §! The army was fierce and disciplined, and every single one of them knew what he was fighting for and was willing to die for it. On the battlefield, however, such men often survive - and their mortal enemies are more likely to fall. In Tiwat, many believe that the possessor of the Eye is the decisive force on the battlefield; But this army was able to fight the "original God" with iron discipline and mortal body."
DOT_Government_Army6:0 "All as One"
DOT_Government_Army6_desc:0 "§Y equivalent to "Steel discipline" "Arise, you who do not want to be slaves!" §! Mature military democracy, strong national cohesion, brave and decisive soldiers, battle-hardened command system, enlightened and advanced government organization, and military theory one step faster, only these six things together can make this miraculous army stand on the historical stage for a short time. In this army, Eye holders and ordinary soldiers work together on an equal footing to prepare battle plans. Even if they are beaten down to three men, they can still make plans to continue fighting; People celebrated their courage, trusted their discipline, and hailed them as heroes. They are not numbed pieces on a commander's chessboard, but shining warriors."
#科研
DOT_Research:0 "Scientific research construction level"
DOT_Government_Research1:0 "No professional scholars"
DOT_Government_Research1_desc:0 "Limited by the backward level of education and social development, there are few full-time researchers here, and most of the scientific research depends on a bright person's flash and external input, which means that the technology here is often behind the average level of Tewatt."
DOT_Government_Research2:0 "Lack of research institutions"
DOT_Government_Research2_desc:0 "Although there are a certain number of scholars here, there is a lack of scientific research institutions to organize them together and apply their research results. Many scholars fight for themselves in the research field, resulting in a large number of repeated studies, and many achievements have not been put into practical application after they appear."
DOT_Government_Research3:0 "Forming a scientific Research System"
DOT_Government_Research3_desc:0 "The scientific research system here has taken shape, a large number of relevant laws have been put in place, creating a good academic environment, researchers can benefit from the results, and progress in the field of production is also driven by technological innovation."
DOT_Government_Research4:0 "Efficient scientific research System"
DOT_Government_Research4_desc:0 "Here, when a person enters the future profession of scientific research, the following educational path will be like a smooth slide to the end of "entry into the scientific institution", and each new achievement he creates can be quickly tested. It is then applied in a subtle way to the actual production, and the whole process is more smooth than drinking a hundred cups of aloe vera juice and using Jushuang to release the self."
