SUM_Wise_of_country:0 "Nation of Wisdom"
SUM_Wise_of_country_desc:0 "As the Nation of Wisdom, Sumeru boasts the most comprehensive knowledge of Teyvat's nations, attracts many academics from across the lands, and is Teyvat's most crucial academic hub."
SUM_Akasha_Terminal:0 "The Akasha Terminal"
SUM_Akasha_Terminal_desc:0 "The Akademiya utilized Greater Lord Rukkhadevata’s Irminsul and Gnosis to manage knowledge as a resource. One simply needs to put on and turn on the Akasha Terminal to gain instant access to any desired wisdom in the Irminsul."
SUM_Depend_on_Akasha_Terminal:0 "Dependence on the Akasha Terminal"
SUM_Depend_on_Akasha_Terminal_desc:0 "500 years of Khaenri’ah’s extinction and Rukkhadevata’s death deprived Sumeru of sources of knowledge and motivation for research. Though the Akademiya appears technologically flourishing, its reality is stagnant. Regular Sumerian academics lack the fundamental desires for learning due to over-dependence on the Akasha Terminal and Canned Knowledge, devolving into paper-writing machines."
SUM_King_Deshret_Believers_Revolt:0 "Revolt of King Deshret’s Believers"
SUM_King_Deshret_Believers_Revolt_desc:0 "Due to problematic historical records and discriminatory Akademiya policies, King Deshret’s followers reject the coexistence between Deshret and Rukkhadevata while preparing for Deshret’s glorious return. Deshret’s followers have already infiltrated the Eremites of Sumeru’s vast deserts and coordinated with forces from the Gilded and Hadramaveth Deserts, waiting for their moment to strike."
SUM_The_Imprisoned_God:0 "The Imprisoned Archon"
SUM_The_Imprisoned_God_desc:0 "Following Khaenri’ah’s extinction and Greater Lord Rukkhadevata’s disappearance 500 years ago, the Akademiya took the newborn Dendro Archon back to Sumeru and named her “Lesser Lord Kusanali.” However, Kusanali is too weak to receive Akademiya approval as Rukkhadevata’s successor and has been under house arrest in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, while the Akademiya ignores widespread rumors of her status. Therefore, not many Sumerians take Kusanali seriously, and some Rukkhadevata followers even believe in the Greater Lord’s survival and vow to rescue her."
SUM_The_Freedom_God:0 "The Revitalized Archon"
SUM_The_Freedom_God_desc:0 "Lesser Lord Kusanali, with the help of the Traveler and many other followers, successfully broke her Akademiya chains. With the renewed leadership of Lesser Lord Kusanali, Sumeru shall flow with fresh knowledge and life!"
SUM_The_Akademiya01:0 "Akademiya Corruption"
SUM_The_Akademiya01_desc:0 "The Akademiya is Sumeru’s primary academic organization while also controlling its politics. The ignorance and foolishness of Akademiya scholars spawn endless infighting, corrupting the daily mechanisms of the Sumerian government and further deepening the ongoing political crisis."
SUM_The_Akademiya02:0 "Ongoing Akademiya Reforms"
SUM_The_Akademiya02_desc:0 "The Akademiya Reforms have officially begun, though the process will be slow and painful."
SUM_The_Akademiya03:0 "The Akademiya Reformed"
SUM_Wall_of_Samiel:0 "The Wall of Samiel"
SUM_Wall_of_Samiel_desc:0 "Millennia ago, Rukkhadevata created her civilization in the rainforest and erected the Wall of Samiel, sheltering Sumeru City and the forest people from desertification, guaranteeing Sumeru’s prolonged safety."
SUM_No_Balance_State_Industry:0 "Unbalanced State Industry"
SUM_No_Balance_State_Industry_desc:0 "Akademiya discrimination between desert and forest areas and King Deshret’s followers wreaking havoc in the deserts forced desert development projects to pause indefinitely, causing desert economies and academics to lag far behind those in the forest."
SUM_Marana:0 "Harms of Marana"
SUM_Marana_desc:0 "Marana dispersed around Sumeru is the most pressing issue for Forest Rangers, born from forbidden knowledge not belonging to Teyvat, constantly corrupting the land and threatening the life and livelihoods of Sumerians."
SUM_Eleazar:0 "Eleazar Illness"

However, it wasn’t until the Traveler’s arrival that the oppressive rule of Grand Sage Azar and his goons, such as Setaria, gradually began to come to a head with those they ruled. Though imprisoned in the Sanctuary of Surasthana, Kusanali can still observe Sumeru’s entirety with her powers and will do everything to stop anyone from acting against obliviousness. The higher Kusanali’s satisfaction, the lesser the risk of a civil war, which is also tied to national spirits and political decisions. \n\n\n__________________________________\n\nKusanali’s Satisfaction：§G[?csmyd]%§!\n"
