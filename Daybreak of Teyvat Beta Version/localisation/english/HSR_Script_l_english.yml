 HSR_News.1.t: “A mysterious force from beyond the heavens”
 HSR_News.1.d: “A mysterious force from beyond the heavens has descended upon Tivat, calling themselves the Star Vault Alliance, followers of the ‘pioneering’ Star God, Akivili. After the fall of the “Pathfinder” star god Akivili, his will of pioneering was inherited by his followers, the Nameless Guests, including the Star Dome Train, which he had once traveled on. However, the “Cancer of the Worlds” has spread, and the silver rails on which the train rests are not immune to it. Before the epidemic arrived, the train was already struggling, and when the road was blocked, it had to be quietly grounded. After years and years of this, a red-haired girl meets the deserted train. Intrigued by the silent story left between the engine and the silver track, she took the time to fill in the cracks, smooth out the wear and tear, and repair the train up and down. And so, the curious and still different maidens stepped into the train's compartments and began a pioneering journey to measure the universe. They hope to establish a stronghold on Tivat and create a connection to the vastness of the universe for Tivat!”
