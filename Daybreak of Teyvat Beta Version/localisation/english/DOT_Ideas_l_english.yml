However, due to their own greed, mankind took the liberty of researching forbidden technologies, which brought about wars and the destruction of civilization. Human civilization was slowly revived under the protection of the gods, and the gods established the Island in the Sky. Through their faith in the gods, the people were given the power to drive the elements and build their homes in the wilderness. The gods observed the human race from the Sky Island and chose outstanding individuals to ascend to the Sky Island and become gods, guarding the world order."
