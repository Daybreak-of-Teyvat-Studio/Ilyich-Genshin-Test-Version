 DOT_INTRO_TEXT_1:0 "I. The Great Music of the Millennium \n\n Nearly three thousand years ago, §G Barbatos§! On the priestess §G Guenhild§! was elevated to godhood in the prayers of the priestesses, and led the people of Mund to overthrow the tyranny of the Lone King of §L Gotha§! The people of Mund were led to overthrow the tyranny of the Lone King of Hightower§! was then promoted to godhood in the battle. After \n\n became the king of the earthly winds, §G Barbatos§! used the divine wind to blow away the snow and ice and split the mountains, transforming Mund into a paradise where grass and trees flourish. The people of \n\nMund moved out from the old royal capital in droves, establishing clan after clan in the land of Mund, which later developed into villages and cities, and the leaders of the clans evolved into the §8 Nobility§! \n\n Initially treated as §G leaders§! The nobles who were initially regarded as §G-leaders§! were quickly corrupted and regarded themselves as §8-masters§! The nobles led by \n Lawrence brought slavery into the land and rode on top of the people of Mund to enjoy the wine and meat. \n The God of Wind, who did not want to be king, heard the mournful cries of the people of Mund and woke up from his long sleep. After witnessing the brutality of the nobles, he forged the contract of the King of Rock §C to agitate the people§! \n\n Eventually, the gladiatorial slave from Natha, §R "Winnisha"§! raised the high banner of rebellion, and the people of all Mund took up arms, and the hue and cry finally broke through the prison of Gale. The old nobility was overthrown and the new new Mond was established. \n\nThus, Mond became the present situation where the Knights of the West Wind defended Mond at the centre and the regions were autonomous. However, under the successive suppression of the Lone King of the High Tower and the old nobles, Mond did not give birth to sufficiently advanced humanistic ideas, and the people of Mond only destroyed everything that they thought might bring oppression, and established a system that only embodied superficial freedom. As the theoretical central government, the Order of the West Winds has no power to interfere with the policies of the major self-governing territories outside of Mund, and cannot even guarantee tax or military support from them, as the financial and centralised system of power inherited from the old aristocracy is contrary to "freedom". The Church of the West Wind also acts on its own in all of Monde, as this is also a manifestation of "freedom". \n\nII, Prelude to the Second Movement\n\nUnder these circumstances, Mond still stumbled on for thousands of years, until another new crisis arrived. \n\nIn the last hundred years, Fontaine's advanced technology had come from the West, and the great advances in energy and production technology had led to an unprecedented boom in Monde's industry, with the number of industrial workers increasing day by day, and Monde's economy flourishing in a seemingly never-ending way. Beneath the glow of prosperity, on the other hand, was the shadow of internal and external problems. The friendly situation between the \n/\n to Winter Kingdom and Mond was reversing, and in recent years, the Fools' Crowd had always been infiltrating and subverting Mond, and they had continued to fund the various ambitious individuals within Mond in an attempt to keep Mond from breaking down. \n the south of the Liyue although there is no idea of using military force against Mond, their ideas and economic activities have been influencing Mond, those ideas with Enlightenmentism is the most popular among the people of Mond. This idea, pioneered by Yu Heng Xing Kue Qing, favours the extremely heretical complete rule of man, and its influence is rising rapidly. \n\n Half a year ago, the conquest and creation of the legendary Knight-§G Falga§! The expedition of the Grand Master even put heavy pressure on the defence of Mond, and he led four-fifths of the Knights of the West Wind to leave Mond once more and set out on an expedition. Even though Guernhild's eldest daughter and the Order's acting Grandmaster §C琴-Guernhild§! had taken on the job of Grand Master and become the substantial leader of the Order long before that, the weakness seemed unbearable. \n\nToday's Monde has long ceased to be as harmonious as it once was. Under the free system, all kinds of dissent came in like a tidal wave. \n\nThe head of Qin's mind, a hidden idea was flickering - she wanted to carry out §Create a reformed system§! in the smooth running of Mond! practice, but this path does not necessarily point to §G freedom§! and could also lead to §8Disaster§! \n\\nThe long-absent wind god strengthened people's piety, causing countless people among the orthodox churches to become gradually corrupted, and triggering popular discontent. Returning from Fontaine, §8 Rosalia§! Taking advantage of this dissatisfaction, she established the §gChurch Opposition§! which took deep roots in the eastern part of Mond and waited for an opportunity to expand its influence, with the intention of forging Mond into a place that could §gure long-term stability§! and a sword against the dangers of the future. Barbara, who accidentally became the nominal leader of the opposition, was aware of the dangers inherent in this organisation. aware of the dangers implicit in this organisation, proposes a new interpretation that differs from both Rosalia and the orthodox Church - §t Liberation Theology§! , determined to use its own power to bring the §g church opposition§! to lead the §C moderate orthodoxy§! After the \n\n expedition sent to the Dragon's Ridge Snow Mountains reported back on the riches and mysteries of this frozen land, the Order sent §C Abedo§! He and many scholars have been able to attract immigrants, develop resources, organise commerce and trade, and make use of the facilities left behind by the ancient civilisation of Shar-Findnir, making the Dragon Ridge Snow Mountain Territory a prosperous area that is noticed by the Order. The Dragon Ridge Snow Mountain Collar is loyal to Mond, loyal to freedom - but if disaster strikes and the Order is devastated, they don't know what kind of §Cchoices§ they will make if they lose their shelter! \n\nThe Leghornfinde Collar has long been a powerful influence in the region of Mond. The Leigonfinde family that holds this place is led by the family's young master, §R Diluke§! As the head of the family, he pursues the principle of extreme heroism, punishing the evil and promoting the good based on his own judgement. If the Order fails to deal with Mond's problems, DeLuc doesn't mind §R intervening§! , or even§g take its place§! \n\\nThe Running Wolf Territory had long been on the fringes of Mond's affairs, and both industrialisation and expeditions had little to do with this forest. But on this land sleeps the soul of the Wolf King Andrius, and on this land, the warriors under the Wolf King are invincible. If Mund falls into chaos, the refugees who have fled here may use this power to defend themselves. If the chaos in Mund continues, they will realise that they have enough power in their hands to §RPeace §! §C. Monde§! of §8 power§! ......\n\nThe Gunnhilde family's power is rooted in the Gunnhilde domain, and they have been holding down the border to Winter§C for a long time. , and even if chaos comes, they will just sit back and watch the war spread in the north of Mund until a winner is decided. \n\nBesides that, there is also the Wind Dragon Collar governed by scout knight Amber, whose decisions will also affect the future direction of Mund in the face of Tervalin's dissension and bandit attacks. \n\nIn recent months there have been repeated sightings of Tevarin throughout Mond. Though Chin has stated that nothing has happened. But Wendy, who had secretly returned to Mond, had already informed her of the fact that Tevarin had been contaminated by an unknown source - the city of Mond was at stake. If the Wind Demon Dragon crisis could not be dealt with, then the §8Lawrence family§! may then use the opportunity to start a civil war in order to seek a restoration, and various local forces will also take over the mountain. After all, if §G Freedom§! can't bring people safety, then they will seek §GClassical Freedom§! and even - - §8 to the paths other than those of §G classical freedom§! and even - §8 resort to tyranny§!"
 DOT_INTRO_TEXT_2:0 "\n\nReceiving an invitation from the Liyue Chamber of Commerce and the Adventurer's Guild for me to write this travelogue of the port of Liyue for the call for papers, I hesitated for a long time. On the one hand, I have followed my father's caravan from the time I was a child to run a business all over the continent of Tivat, and the number of times I have been to the port of Liyue is not one hundred, but also eighty times, so it is true that there will not be any outsider who is more familiar with the routes that lead to the port of Liyue than I am. On the other hand, I am worried that although I have met some poets and writers along the way due to my business, I am still a rough man and will not be able to write interesting words that will please all of you. I hope you will bear with me on this point. \n\nWhen I was a child, Riyue, which boasts the world's largest trading port, was already synonymous with prosperity and development among the merchant caravans. Every time I heard that the destination of the caravan was Riyue, the children would beg for a small place in the caravan or in the cabin to take themselves along, relying on the favour of their fathers. Although time has passed, the memories of travelling with the caravan to Li Yue have never faded. The busy streets, the bustling crowds, the novelty of the playthings and the exquisite handicrafts displayed in the shops were so clear in my mind that even the steaming heat from the food stalls seemed to convey some mysterious message. \n\nWhen I came of age, my father entrusted me with the family business, and I personally led the merchant fleet from city to city in the Tivat continent, the concept of Riyue didn't just remain in the harbour where I ran around with my feet spread out in my childhood. \n\nJust from what I've learnt about the history of the development of the Liyue port over the years, I would venture to make this conclusion. Like any developed town in the Tivat continent, Li Yue's rapid development could not be separated from the help of its favourable geographical location. This harbour city surrounded by mountains on three sides has a diverse landscape radiating outwards by land - rolling foothills, vast shallows and plains. On land, precious mineral deposits are dug out of pits, smelted by miners and polished by craftsmen, and transformed into exquisite artefacts that see the light of day. The establishment of harbours and the opening up of shipping routes brought about the rise of trade, allowing these crafts to go out to sea and laying the initial foundation for Li Yue's economic development. Not only that, to this day, those exquisite crafts of Li Yue are still loved by people from all over the Tivat Continent. \n\nThe trade route to Li Yue from the sea has developed over a long period of time, and the current scale has become very mature. Generally speaking, when travelling to Riyue to conduct trade activities, merchant ships are the first thing we recommend. However, if you are looking for advice for first-time travellers to Riyue, the land route is a much more enriching experience than spending time in the vast expanse of the ocean. \n\nConsidering the complex terrain around us, the most common route to Riyue by land is from the Morningside Winery outside of Monde City to the southwest. If you follow the main road, you can see the roadside scenery with great Monde characteristics stretching forward. Bringing three or two of Mond's local fruits with you, it doesn't take long to get your feet wet, as the lake and the foothills towering on both sides of the lake cut off the greenery of the previous roadside, foreshadowing the imminent arrival at Mond's border. \n\nthe west along the lake, two towering cliffs - oddly angled and narrowed by a boarded-up road formed a natural barrier, separating Riyue and Mond on either side in two different worlds. In my youth, I passed through here, never stifled in my efforts to make time. Then once, I happened to be travelling in the company of an elderly fisherman. As we passed through this stretch of road, the old man talked from how to tell the good from the bad perch in the river all the way to the long-ago legend of Riyue, saying that the lakes in the valleys were all sweet rains laid down by the Emperor of the Rock King, and that by staying a little longer in such a place I might be able to get a little closer to the gods. \n\nI have always laughed off such rumours and stories, but my lively and romantic lady, whose mind was also full of whimsy, believed them. Since then, every time my caravan travelled to Riyue by this route, we would stop here to rest before moving on, hoping that the gods would indeed shower us with more blessings. \n\nAfter passing through this stone gate made of crags, the blockage in front of us completely disappeared and the scenery became clear. This area was typical of the landscape on the outskirts of Ritsuki - water and swamps scattered in all directions reflected the sky, and the narrow shallows where the water and swamps met were covered in sparse green vegetation. The most striking spectacle in the distance was the Wangshu Inn, located on the Ogiwa Island. This far-flung building was constructed on a massive pillar of rock, a landmark to the caravan's people. Upon arriving at the Wangshu Inn, some of the foreign merchants were directly here to trade with the local caravans of Riyue. The other part of the group would temporarily rest here, do some small business or exchange information, and then head towards the port of Li Yue Harbour after resting and recuperating. \n\nThere are so many journeys and memories of Riyue that I can't go into them all for reasons of space. From childhood to youth to middle age, the port of Riyue from different times overlapped in my mind. Well, I really don't know how to end it. There might be someone who remembers me from those walks. \n\nRitsuki is a rich harbour located in the east of the Tivat continent. The proudly standing foothills and stone forests, the vast plains and the vibrant riverbanks together form the rich landscape of Riyue, which glows with colourful splendour under the climate of the four distinct seasons. How many ancient gifts of the Magic God of Rock are buried among the wonders of the mountains and rocks waiting to be discovered?"

Now under the rule of the Order of the West Wind, each man is bathed in his own freedom -- if not for Tervalin, the dragon of the East Wind who has been corrupted by the Order of the Abyss. Under the dragon disaster, the fools are ready to act, and the Lawrence family has been overthrown, and a huge conspiracy is brewing. Can the Zewind Knights still maintain the freedom that Mond is proud of?"
 Book_LAW:0 "[Uncompleted]The ancestral plume on the brim of Maunder's hat when he used to hunt is still standing tall and empty. Now it has all turned to dust.

Now that the order's main force has moved away from Maunder, there is no better time for the family to build its legacy. Unfortunately, the current last descendants have forgotten the obligations of the clan. To use power only as a decoration of clothing, fraud as a mood to get along with people, God called the trial of fearless exploration. Now, where will the ice, once known as Maunder's light, go?"
