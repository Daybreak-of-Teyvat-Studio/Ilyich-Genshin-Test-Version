 LYY_food_and_goods:0""Food and Goods Chronicle""
 LYY_food_and_goods_desc:0" "Hong Fan" eight policies, one is food, the other is goods. Food refers to the food that can be eaten in farming and farming, and goods refers to cloth, silk, clothing, gold, knives, turtles and shells, so the distribution of wealth is beneficial. There is no such thing. The two are the foundation of the people, which emerged from the time of King Yan. The wood is plough, and the wood is hay. The benefits of raking are used to teach the world and have enough food. The middle of the day is the market, and the people of the world are brought to the world. Gather the goods of the world, trade them, and withdraw them. Everyone gets their own place, and the goods are circulated. If the food is sufficient, the goods are circulated, and then the country is strong and the people are prosperous, and education is achieved."

"Ke Qing rushed into the Qun Jade Pavilion and found that the other six people except herself had been waiting here for a long time - or in other words, they had not left even a step since the emperor was assassinated.\nEveryone's face looked haggard. He has been very busy these past few days, and even Ning Guang is no longer as calm as usual, and his eyes show a little tiredness.\n"Ke Qing, you are here, is there any new news from Qian Yanjun?" ”\n“No progress. "\n"We must find a new way! "\n"Liyue will collapse if this continues!

Although Wanmintang is far smaller than the above two, but But it has managed to survive in Liyue's catering industry with its friendliness and quality. Forget about the two major cuisines!

 KQP_Formation_of_the_Peoples_Revolutionary_Committee_desc: "After the assassination of the emperor, Ningguang used the slogan of "New Deal" to transcend the seven-star system and usurp the supreme power. However, as a "Tianquanxing", she made mistakes and made frequent mistakes: not only did she not solve the problem The credit crisis caused by the assassination of the emperor also provoked a unnecessary war. Faced with the tragic situation in Liyue, Yuhengxing could no longer tolerate Ningguang's retrograde actions and launched this revolutionary movement. Now, according to the Dong's suggestion. Keqing decided to abolish the old seven-star system and instead establish a People's Revolutionary Committee elected by the people of Liyue Hong Kong in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the people and voluntarily defend their motherland.

 LYY_New_Event.1.t:0"Farewell Ganlin for now"
 LYY_New_Event.1.d:0" At the end of the ceremony, Emperor Morax passed away. Everyone present was considered to be suspected of committing the crime, and Keqing was no exception. After Qianyanjun repeatedly investigated clues to the crime, he was only at the scene. Traces of ice elemental power were found and the case was hastily closed. The people of Liyue could not accept such a result and asked the Seven Stars of Liyue to give a reply and formally mourn the emperor. On the Liyue Calendar Day of Waking of Insects, in Liyue represented by Qingqing and Ningguang At the press conference held by Yue Qixing and Shengshengtang, represented by Hutao and Zhongli, Keqing originally thought that Ningguang would read the manuscript written by Yue Haiting, but things went beyond expectations. Ningguang spoke plausibly to many reporters. Said: "According to Qian Yanjun's latest investigation, we found Qingxin's incomplete petals at the crime scene. This is our important evidence for the emperor's assassination case. I believe the results will be announced to everyone soon." "Then, under Ke Qing's astonished eyes, Ningguang said the press conference was over. On the same day, the price of Qingxin plummeted.\n"What are you doing? This is completely different from what was promised! "Back at Qunyu Pavilion, Ke Qing angrily came to Ningguang to question her.\nNingguang didn't even raise his head: "A piece of Qingxin petal doesn't mean anything. There are many people who eat Qingxin as food. Don't worry, we have to consider the new Liyue Port business plan in the near future. Don't come to me easily if you have nothing important to do. Bai Xiao, seeing off guests. "\nKe Qing clenched her fists, but she had no choice but to leave Qunyu Pavilion angrily. Ke Qing thought that this matter would not involve a specific person, but she was wrong.\n Outside Bu Lu's door, Gan Yu looked at the cheap Qing Xin and hesitated before going in. Just as he was about to take out the mora to buy, two Qianyan officers entered Bu Bu's house and said to Gan Yu seriously: "You are suspected of being suspected of It is related to the assassination of the emperor. Please come back with us to assist in the investigation. "Although Gan Yu was confused, he left with them in order not to interfere with other people's medical treatment and medicine purchase. A reporter who had just entered Bu Bu Lu took a picture of this scene, and the headline that night [Shocked, Gan Yu was actually the real person in the emperor's assassination case" fierce!]."
 LYY_New_Event.1.a:0 "How can a secretary assassinate the emperor?"
 LYY_New_Event.2.t:0"What can I do about it?"
 LYY_New_Event.2.d:0" Keqing angrily put the newspaper on the ground and said: "What kind of rubbish is this? Is the chief secretary of Yuehaiting the murderer? This is the Moon Sea Pavilion, where are the Seven Stars?Let's see how long this reporter can exist..." But other people in Yujingtai turned a deaf ear, and Yuehaiting turned a blind eye, as if Gan Yu's existence had nothing to do with them, and the follow-up was like nothing. And Yuehaiting's other secretaries were not like Gan Yu Rain only needs a few sweet flowers to happily accompany you to work overtime all night long. You need to brew the refreshing strong tea from Qiao Yingzhuang in advance, or the best coffee cocoa from Nata. The frost in Yujing's tiles is heavy, and the jade quilt is cold Who will share it? Keqing doesn't want Gan Yu to bear the name he shouldn't bear.\nWhat's even more unfavorable is that due to the emperor's death, various Liyue projects and archaeological excavations have been suspended for a long time. The workers have no salary to receive, and they doubt the Yuheng Star He has become a different person; Liyue Port is booming due to the stock market, and people are praising Ningguang's achievements. Seeing that Keqing's influence is declining day by day, it is as if Ganyu's disappearance is a preview of Keqing. Indecisiveness is not the fault of Qixing. Always ask yourself: "What can we do to break the deadlock? ""

"\nThe secretary placed two red briefcases casually in the corner of Keqing's desk.\n"There is so little work. "Ke Qing sighed and opened one of the briefcases. Suspension of work start notices and compensation for unemployed workers. A lot of troublesome and unnecessary things. Ke Qing has never hated her job so much. \n "Giggle" before Ke Qing said "come in", the secretary opened the door. Turning a blind eye to her dissatisfied look, the secretary handed her a document. "This is a document that Lord Tianquan wants to publish to the public. Please take a look at it." "Correct it"\nBe proud of it, you will pay the price for it later. Ke Qing looked sideways at the secretary's arrogant look, secretly clenching her fists. She took the document and carefully examined every word on it. While quickly browsing the documents, Keqing was also thinking about how to stop workers from complaining and divert the public away from the Gan Yu incident.\n"Yes. "Ke Qing picked up the pen and left a line of words in the column of "Liyue New Project Construction"."

 LYY_New_Event.4.d:0"It is Qingming Festival in Liyue, and it is raining continuously. Inside the Third Prison of Liyueyan:\n"Master Yuheng, you can't go in! "\n"Why? What's wrong with me monitoring the interrogation process? "\n"But. Lord Tianquan has an order that no one can enter except her old man. Master Yuheng, it is difficult for you to do this at such a young age. "\n"Tell Ningguang, she is a Seven Star, and I am also a Seven Star. Why should I follow her lead? Open the door! "\n" I have reminded you, Mr. Yuheng, many times. The consequences of offending Mr. Tianquan are beyond my imagination. "After that, he let Keqing in. She was born in a noble family and had a higher education. She was shocked by the scene before her - there was no natural light in a place where sunlight could not reach because of rainy days. When she opened the door of the office area, a sudden light suddenly appeared in front of her. The dimming lights seemed like a horror movie, and there was still water leaking from the gaps in the corridor walls.\nKe Qing touched the clammy wall and walked to the end, opening the heavy iron door. What she saw inside made her wonder if she was still in the glass. Yue:\nThe dark room was illuminated only by a few torches. There was a cross-shaped torture rack in the middle, and Gan Yu was tied to it. Her hands were tightly tied to both ends of the wooden frame with iron wires, and the blood marks on her wrists were consistent with the iron wires. Rong, his feet were not on the ground so that his body was tense, and there was still a glass bag that had been chewed to no avail at the corner of his mouth. Gan Yu's expensive silk coat had long been divided, and only the tattered black silk stockings were barely covering it. Body. The most distressing thing for Ke Qing is the countless whip marks on Gan Yu's body, which makes the blue and purple dragon roar on the originally white and tender skin. One can imagine the inhuman torture she suffered here. Ke Qing When Gan Yu stepped forward to see the injury, he instinctively shrank and murmured: "Don't...don't hit me...it hurts...I said...nothing...don't..."\nSeeing Gan Yu's miserable state , Keqing's nose became sore, and tears left her cheeks. But she stopped quickly, Gan Yu needed someone strong to protect her. She softly but decisively ordered the jailer: "Let her go. immediately. "\nThe jailers looked at each other, but made no move.\n"I said let her go! "Ke Qing's voice became louder, and she pulled out the sword from her waist. The sound of piercing the air was like thunder striking the deep valley.\nThe little jailer timidly muttered: "Lord Tianquan..."\nKe Qing's Anger finally broke out. "When did Ningguang let you abuse lynching? Or are you from Duyuehaiting? "She put her sword against the jailer's neck. "Don't you think your life is tough? I'll count to ten. If you don't let go, you won't be able to eat any juice! "\nHearing Ke Qing's threat, the jailer did not dare to neglect, and unloaded Gan Yu from the wooden frame in a hurry. \nGan Yu's consciousness was mixed, and he murmured: "The Emperor... is not... me ". Ke Qing said: "
 LYY_New_Event.4.a:0"Gan Yu, I'm late——"
 LYY_New_Event.5.t:0"Le Mo Le Xi New Acquaintance"
 LYY_New_Event.5.d:0"Since Gan Yu left the prison on Qingming Day, Ke Qing took a long leave to take care of Gan Yu at home, and asked Dr. Baizhu to treat him attentively, but Gan Yu's mental depression could not be restored in a day. In Once, when Baizhu was preparing to inject Gan Yu with the glazed lily compound, Gan Yu shed tears as soon as she recalled the painful memories before, and murmured: "I...wasn't..." Ke Qing had no choice but to step forward to comfort Gan Yu and wiped her face. He wiped away the tears and kissed Gan Yu's cheek. Gan Yu calmed down: "I seemed to have had a long dream, surrounded by powerful monsters. I wanted to call out to the emperor, but there was no response; when I wanted to give up, you appeared in time to save me from danger. Now..." Ke Qing did not choose to continue listening, and kissed Gan Yu's lips. Although it was slightly bitter, the aftertaste was sweet.\nWhen Dr. Bai Zhu wanted to leave Ke Qing's home, he was stopped by the oncoming glare. : "Mr. Bai Shu, please be patient and come in with me. "Then, Ning Guang saw Ke Qing who had just come out of the bedroom, and said with a hint of ridicule: "It turns out that Mr. Yu Heng, who does everything himself, can also be lazy... huh? "Ke Qing said nothing and pointed at Gan Yu who was still in the bedroom. Ning Guang's voice was a little weaker: "Master Yu Heng did not hesitate to slow down the construction of Liyue Port for this reason. "Keqing waved her hand, indicating that Dr. Baizhu should do more important things. Then she said: "If you thought you were right at the beginning, then Ganyu will be the consequence; the price of Qingxin keeps falling again and again, and I don't know how many people are affected by this. Implicated; the ground in Jueyunjian was turned over again, almost disturbing the residence of the Xian family. Are these all part of your plan? Although Ningguang felt resentful, he lowered his voice and said: "The stagnation in the development of Liyue Port is the price of the entire incident. Liyue cannot afford such a result." " \nYou just can't eat it. Keqing thought to herself that she knew what Ningguang wanted. This woman would never give up any Mora. "Ningguang, we are all businessmen and we know everyone's needs. Well, I can come forward and stabilize the price of Qingxin. "\nNingguang smiled: "Thank you, Mr. Yuheng. This kind of work is very heavy, adults, please don't work so hard. How about I get a secretary for you? She pretended to think for a while. "How about just Miss Gan Yu?" "\nKeqing also smiled."
 LYY_New_Event.5.a:0""Thank you, Lord Tianquan. " "
 LYY_New_Event.6.t:0"Words of the same mind smell like orchids"
 LYY_New_Event.6.d:0"Since reaching a verbal agreement with Ningguang, he has not bothered Keqing and Ganyu for several days. At this moment, Keqing is also thinking: "Why did she desperately contradict Ningguang to save Ganyu? Yu, why can Gan Yu trust me without any complaints? "All this makes Ke Qing forget about food and tea.\n" Mr. Yuheng, based on Miss Gan Yu's current situation, Bai Mou re-drafted the prescription. Following medical advice can help wounds heal. "Baizhu walked to Keqing and whispered softly, so as not to disturb Gan Yu who was sleeping soundly. But Keqing didn't even see it. The eyes of the blue-haired fairy beast lying on the couch opened a small slit. Even Gan Yu Dr. Bai would also notice that Yu was so cautious. He walked quickly forward to Gan Yu to check on Gan Yu's condition. "Bai has done what the lady said, so I'll take my leave first. "Time flies quickly, the lights gradually turn on, and the night becomes darker. \nThe bathroom in Keqing's residence has been decorated according to Baizhu's instructions. The soft lighting and special scented candles exude an irresistible aroma, making the atmosphere even more enchanting. Comfortable. The doctor said that this will help Gan Yu's mental recovery. The large bathtub in the middle can accommodate more than three people, and naturally it can also accommodate the bodies of two girls. Gan Yu's thin body was slowly hugged by Ke Qing and warmed In the hot bath water, the medicated bath has a slightly green color, like a pot of brewed tea, exuding a faint fragrance, turning into mist, rising in the room, and slowly filling every corner of the room. Ke Qingtuo He held Gan Yu's body and let her lean against him. White mist floated in the room. The comfortable scent of herbs and the warm medicinal bath that soothed the mind and body were an excellent way to relax at any time, but now , the first priority is to clean up the body of the half-immortal who is leaning in her arms.\nKe Qing gently smelled the fragrance of the medicine, and sprinkled a spoonful of water on the scar on Gan Yu's shoulder. Gan Yu bit his lower lip: "Jade Lord Heng...it hurts so much. "Ke Qing immersed Gan Yu's body deeper, but she didn't know that the two of them were already tightly touching each other. The wet green hair stuck to her back, and occasionally a few strands stubbornly entangled with the purple hair. Warm The water in the pool gradually relaxed the two of them, forgetting their fatigue; the mist filled the air, gradually captivating their eyes. In a blur, Keqing felt that her collarbone, chest, lower abdomen and even lower body had not been spared, and the excitement aroused The spray of water covered up the touch of the feet under the water. Gan Yu's many years of experience in working at Haiting allowed her to knock on the door of Ke Qing's heart with ease and run wildly; but what remained in Ke Qing's heart was the sweet memory of the two of them. . Ke Qing put her left hand around Gan Yu's back, and with her right hand, Gan Yu pressed into the pool. She muttered in a low voice: "Little Gan Yu is really passionate, look at me..." Gan Yu exclaimed, but also took advantage of the chaos. Keqing's hair was messed up. Gan Yu held a medicinal herb in her mouth and rubbed Keqing's cheek. The blush gradually became thicker, as if she was drunk, sending an ambiguous message. Keqing stood up and approached Gan Yu's earlobe, biting it gently, her red lips Holding the pink earlobe, licking the ear with the tip of the tongue, exhaling slowly. Finally, he left reluctantly, and the crystal silver thread pulled out a star river in the sky.\nThe way the two of them were still unfinished after the bath showed that it was not a single person's dream just now. They were not similar but different. Keqing pulled Gan Yu to lie on her bed, put her cherished feather belt next to Gan Yu's red rope, and then lay on the bed and touched her hair..."

 LYY_New_Event.7.d:0"Keqing is very happy these days, and everything is developing in a good direction. With her company and care, Gan Yu has recovered more than half of her body and can handle paperwork normally. Road. The construction of the project is also getting better. She also recruited workers who had lost their jobs due to the shutdown to carry out the construction. The progress of the project was faster than expected. It is expected to be opened to traffic before the Zhuyue Festival. Complaints about Yuheng It has also gradually disappeared, but the gossip about Ningguang and Keqing in Liyue Port has begun to emerge. One day when Ningguang was free, he went to the Zhutianfang Stock Exchange in disguise and watched the rise and fall of the stock prices on the major screens. , just when she was proud of the prosperity of Liyue under her rule, the unusual rise of an agricultural stock from Jueyunjian caught Ningguang's attention. She smiled evilly, and the chance to overthrow Keqing came. She called The subordinate whispered something.\n"Have you heard? The fairy family is manipulating the stock price! "This information was circulated in the streets and alleys of Liyue. Eyeliners all over Liyue immediately reported to Ningguang standing on the Jade Pavilion.\nThe corner of her mouth raised an arc that was difficult to detect. "Investigate carefully, don't If I let any clue go, I will make everyone who blocks Liyue's development pay the price. "Under intentional guidance, it soon turned out that there were spies from the Xian family who were destroying the results of human governance. A dark cloud about the Xian family and people is hanging over Liyue..."
 LYY_New_Event.7.a:0 "Dark clouds are pressing down on the city to destroy it, leading the jade dragon to the jade platform."
 LYY_New_Event.8.t:0"I have no intention of breaking up my family"
 LYY_New_Event.8.d:0" "It's raining..." Gan Yu looked at the patter of rain outside the window, and she was lost in thought. She couldn't help but walked out of the door, leaned against the fence, and watched the rain falling from the cornices. The scent of fresh grass filled her nostrils.\n"Are you listening to the rain? "The purple figure came to Gan Yu's side. "Eh?Lord Yuheng. "She was stunned for a moment, then said hello to Keqing belatedly.\n" I have told you so many times that I want to call you Keqing. "The purple-haired girl was slightly angry, and gently poked Gan Yu's head with her finger, admiring Gan Yu's panic expression. "It's so beautiful. "\n" Oops, it seems I came at the wrong time. "Ningguang's high-pitched voice came, and behind him was a small group of Qianyan Army soldiers. Gan Yu's eyes dodge, his legs and feet went weak, and he fell into Ke Qing's arms. Ke Qing protected Gan Yu behind him and put his hand on the hilt of his sword. Go up and stare at Ning Guang warily. "What do you want to do? "\nNingguang crossed his arms and said, "What are you doing? As Qixing, I must protect the safety of Miss Gan Yu. She raised her voice: "Now that Liyue Port is in turmoil due to the Immortal spy case, and public sentiment is raging, it is difficult for us to ensure that Miss Gan Yu will not be threatened." "\n"Thank you, Lord Tianquan, for your concern, but I can protect myself. "Gan Yu mustered up his courage and faced Ning Guang's eyes. Ke Qing took a step forward and drew out his sword again, just like he did in prison. \nThe sound of the sword breaking through the air was like a dragon's roar, and a burst of thunder fell as if it was God's will. , had no choice but to step back and aim at Keqing with the bayonet-mounted rifle in his hand. For a moment, the swords were tense.\nNingguang waved his hand: "Tsk, tsk, what are you doing? It hurts the harmony among Qixing, so that foreigners can laugh at it, and Mr. Yu Heng doesn't have to be nervous. It’s not that Gan Yu has to suffer the physical pain of prison, but that Miss Gan Yu can return to Yuehai Pavilion and receive Liyue’s most complete protection. Soldiers, stand down. \nQian Yanjun put away his rifle and Ningguang said again: "I have no intention of breaking up lovers. This is God's will." ""
 LYY_New_Event.8.a:0""Miss Ganyu, please come with us""
 LYY_New_Event.9.t:0"Fighting for the sake of sweet rain"
 LYY_New_Event.9.d:0" Seeing that Ningguang's momentum had weakened slightly, Keqing put away her sword. She said to Ningguang, "Whatever goes against you, is against you?" "Gan Yu saw that Ke Qing and Ning Guang were in trouble because of her. He finally let go of his tight grip with Ke Qing and said to Ning Guang: "Master Tian Quan and Master Yu Heng don't have to be like this. I know that I am the chief of Yue Hai Pavilion. The secretary should return to Yuehai Pavilion to work again and not cause any more trouble to Mr. Yuheng. Keqing's eyes widened: "Gan Yu, please don't say impulsive words and succumb to Ningguang's power." " Before Ke Qing finished speaking, Gan Yu took over the topic and said, "Thanks to Master Yu Heng for taking care of me, but I have made up my mind. " Taking the opportunity, he secretly stuffed a leaf of ice lotus into Keqing's hand. The rain started to fall heavily again. When Ningguang saw this, he clapped his hands and said, "Miss Ganyu, this is how Yujingtai can carry out its work better. Soldiers, please ask Miss Gan Yu to return to Yuehai Pavilion. "Two female Qianyan Army soldiers helped Gan Yu back to Yuehai Pavilion. \nEverything was as Ningguang expected. As soon as Gan Yu entered Yuehai Pavilion, Qianyan Army let go of their support, and Gan Yu almost fell. Ningguang. Guang leisurely took out a document and read out: "According to the order of the Liyue Transitional Government, citizen Gan Yu committed the crime of espionage in Liyue for manipulating prices and stealing state secrets. He is now imprisoned in Yuehai Pavilion pending trial. Then he pinched Gan Yu's cheek and said softly: "Has Xiao Ganlin forgotten what the sage Liyue once said?" "After that, Ningguang left Yuehai Pavilion. Gan Yu was confused as to why this happened, and asked Huixin, who was still on duty today, about the reason.\nHuixin saw the Qianyan Army still patrolling outside, and said into Gan Yu's ear: "Lord Gan Yu, you have been deceived by Lord Tianquan, she wants to kill you. "Gan Yu felt a thunderbolt in her heart, but she still looked calm. She did not look at Huixin, she just tilted her head and said in a voice that only they could hear: "Don't be afraid, you go to Lord Yuheng's office and tell me She, everything is going according to plan. "After saying that, she looked at the purple feathers in the black silk stockings and walked deeper into the place without looking back. Huixin saw clearly that Gan Yu raised two fingers to her, which was an emergency signal. Huixin saw Looking at Qian Yanjun outside the door, he ran all the way to Keqing's office in Yujingtai. He panted and said: "Yuheng...Master Yuheng, Master Ganyu, she..." Keqing circled the circle leisurely. Looking at the structural diagram of Yuehai Pavilion, he raised his head and said to Huixin: "Secretary Huixin, thank you for your hard work. I already know it. Also, do you know the rotation time of the Wolhaitei Sengan Army? "Huixin told Keqing everything she saw and heard in detail.\n"I am very grateful, Miss Huixin. You who have been in and out of Yujingtai since childhood should know how to deal with this kind of thing." The purple-haired girl raised her head and stared directly at Huixin.\n"Yes...yes, I didn't see anything today . " "
 LYY_New_Event.9.a:0 "Soldiers are also deceitful."
 LYY_New_Event.10.t:0"We will meet again"
 LYY_New_Event.10.d:0"That night. The underground facilities of Yuehai Pavilion.\nGan Yu wrote hard in the office prepared by Ningguang. Ningguang did fulfill her promise and met Ganyu's needs one by one. Satisfied. However, Qilin's intuition made her feel that something was wrong, but she had not found any abnormalities yet.\nThe clock was ticking, and it was already pointing to midnight.\nGan Yu yawned, thinking about it carefully, it felt like he had been taken to the moon Haiting has not had a meal since then. She wanted to go out to buy something to eat, but a Qianyan soldier happened to bring a drawer of Qingxin flower cake and a small bottle of sweet flower juice. She must drink nectar and eat good harvests, and she is very interested in these fresh flowers. He had some resistance and couldn't help but finish eating them all. After that, he returned to work, only to find an overwhelming fatigue coming over him. Gan Yu, who was already severely sleep deprived, soon fell asleep on the table. \n"Sir , has fallen asleep. "The Qianyan Army soldier on duty said.\n" Very good, you should go and rest too. "Ningguang looked at the soldier who couldn't hide his fatigue and said.\nNingguang couldn't bear to see Gan Yu sleeping at his desk, and wanted to give up for a while. But then he thought that the matter had reached this point and couldn't give up halfway, so he made up his mind and took out A document - written on it is Gan Yu's confession that he "admits" that he is a spy of the Xian family. The confession is so scrawled that it is hard to believe that it was written by Gan Yu. But fingerprints cannot deceive.\nNing Fiber Optic The thin hand held Gan Yu's sleeping hand tightly, took out the ink pad, fixed the posture, and then fixed the paper. Every step was like walking on thin ice, for fear that Gan Yu would suddenly wake up. Fortunately, she slept very sweetly. Ning Guang only noticed Gan at this moment. Yu's hands that had been moisturized for more than three thousand years were exactly the same as hers. "Just... press your fingerprints here." Ningguang leaned gently on Gan Yu's shoulder and said, just like a kind mother teaching her children. Gan Yu kept coming from time to time. Talking in his sleep, Ningguang gently caressed Gan Yu and helped him sleep soundly. Later, seeing the coldness of the basement, he personally put a blanket on Gan Yu and left.\nThe next day, Gan Yu's activity space was limited to this office. Shuimei didn't hit his teeth for a day. And there were no documents that needed Gan Yu to sign in person. Until night fell again, the moonlight hid behind the shadow of the clouds, and algae swarmed in front of the Yuehai Pavilion. Just when the Qianyan Army was changing shifts, a bunch of The purple movie flashed quickly. “Hmm. Am I dazzled? "The soldier at the entrance of Yuehai Pavilion wanted to get closer to check, but in an instant he found that he had been pierced through the throat with a sword. The last thing the soldier saw was a sharp blade with ornate carvings, emitting a strange red light.\nPurple Shadow on the Moon It was like entering an uninhabited land in the sea pavilion, avoiding every patrolling soldier. On the only way she could not avoid it, she would stab everyone present with the long sword in her hand to ensure that she would not be discovered. It was night, Xia Li Longyin drank blood.\nBang - the basement door was opened, and Gan Yu was still huddled in the corner. Without any time to think, Ke Qing pulled Gan Yu towards the back door of Yuehai Pavilion, where he could leave as soon as possible. Liyue Port. As the moon rose, the Qianyan Army patrolling the Yuehai Pavilion noticed something strange. When they were about to pursue them, they encountered a guest who blocked them. Ke Qing did not expect that the plan would be executed so smoothly until it was ensured that there was no pursuit. After the soldiers, Gan Yu looked at Ke Qing who was pulling him to run hard: "Ke Qing, you run slower. I...I can't breathe. "Ke Qing also gasped for breath: "It's now... Don't think so much... Saving your life is the most important. "Then Ke Qing took out the file marked with the word "V" and a large sum of money and said to Gan Yu: "Gan Yu, please leave quickly. Today's Liyue Port really can't guarantee your safety. Go quickly to Jueyunjian and Qingce Village. Go to a place where Ningguang's influence is not that great, until you can protect yourself. The tip of the iceberg of Ningguang's crimes is revealed in the file, please keep it safe. Gan Yu's eyes were filled with tears: "Ke...Ke Qing, what should you do?" Will we meet again in the future? "The guests in the corridor of Yuehai Pavilion returned with peace of mind after seeing that the two of them were safe. Keqing pondered for a moment and then said:"
 LYY_New_Event.10.a:0 "We'll see you again, I promise."
 LYY_New_Event.10.b:0"Leave this to me, you have to take care of yourself."
 LYY_New_Event.11.t:0 "The slight sun shines across the nine places, and the floating colors can be seen in both eyes"
 LYY_New_Event.11.d:0"The news of Gan Yu's escape did not shock Ning Guang too much. On the contrary, she helped Ning Guang's immortal conflict. The news that "the immortal spy Gan Yu has been permanently expelled from Hong Kong" was published in the newspapers. Seeing this, Qing didn't think it was over. On the contrary, the conflict between Ningguang and her was no longer hidden. Liyue faced the danger of splitting for the first time.\nEvery day at the door of Yuhengxing's office, reporters asked who would become Liyue's new girlfriend. At the helm, Ke Qing did not respond, but silently extended his overtime hours, and gradually got into the bad habit of having to drink strong tea to work. "I'm afraid it will be difficult for me to cope if this continues," Ke Qing thought to herself, "It's better to read a book and relax "Mood". As she was talking, she walked through Bubulu and arrived at Feiyunpo.\nAs the largest bookstore in Liyue, Wanwenjishe has a full range of books and albums, and has high-quality services that are far unmatched by public libraries. . Keqing looked at the brochure at the door, entered, ordered a cup of tea, and rested in the bookstore.\nThe early summer sunshine came to the ground through the floor-to-ceiling windows, contrasting with the young man with indigo hair reading quietly by the window. "Gan ..." Ke Qing wanted to say it but took it back. The boy noticed Ke Qing's movements, turned a page of the book and said: "Flowing water does not rot -" \nKe Qing thought thoughtfully: "The door hinge is not beetrooted. . The young man snorted: "I didn't expect to meet Lord Yu Heng here. I am also lucky." "\n Seeing that the boy did not refuse, Ke Qing randomly took out a book from the bookshelf and sat with the boy by the window. The shadows of indigo and violet in the sun gradually lengthened, and Ke Qing took a long breath: "The current situation is Tianquanxing and I are no longer in the same league. Compared with the happy life of the knight in the book, I feel like I am in a whirlpool and it is difficult to escape. You can’t help yourself when doing things, so you must have the same feeling. "\nXingqiu closed the book and stood up from the recliner. "Master Yuheng, when you are in a whirlpool, the truly safe place is not outside the whirlpool. But its center. It’s almost the closing time of Zhutianfang Stock Exchange, let’s take a look at the spoils. \nKeqing smiled: "Then it's better to be respectful than to obey." "\nThe people on the splendid cruise ship came from all over Teyvat. They stared intently at the rise and fall of the stock price on the screen. No one caught a glimpse of the two people in the box.\nXingqiu got straight to the point: "Master Keqing is currently looking for How to counter the Lord Tianquan. "Ke Qing was startled by the young man's frank words and looked around hurriedly. "Although the bookworm doesn't know how to deploy troops and generals, he also knows a thing or two about analyzing situations. Xingqiu continued: "Under the rule of Mr. Quan today, all resources are tilted towards Liyue Port." Because of this, even in Guiliyuan, which is the closest place to Liyue Port, people are not without complaints. Further afield, people's dissatisfaction deepened. "\n"Economy is the lifeblood of Liyue and the foundation of Lord Tianquan. As long as the economy falls into recession or even collapses, the only influence left by Lord Tianquan is Liyue Port and even her Qunyu Pavilion. At that time, the vast underdeveloped areas in Liyue will be in your pocket, Mr. Yuheng. "\n" Very well said. Keqing raised her hand to signal the boy to stop, "But, I have one thing to correct you." Liyue is not my personal property, but belongs to all Liyue people. ""

 LYY_New_Event.12.d:0"The huge abyss of layered rock connects the suburbs of Lisha and Minlin on the ground. Xumi City in the West Pole is home to the south of Liyue. There is a poem praising it: "Thousands of rocks emerge from Minlin, and Hu peeks into the abyss of layered rock. . ". What would the Seven Stars of Liyue think if even one day there was a mutiny in such a dangerous place where "no one can escape"?\nBang - a porcelain tea cup smashed to the ground, "How unreasonable!" What else do these thugs want to do? Immediately block the news and never let the people and immortals know. "Ningguang said plausibly at the Seven Stars meeting. It was hard to imagine that this was Ningguang's state. Yaoguangxing suggested that the fortress in the suburbs of Lisha should be notified immediately to annihilate it nearby. Several others agreed. Only Keqing looked at the table. The layered rock giant abyss on the top - the map of Lisha Suburbs was silent. After a while, Keqing stood up and pointed to the pass of Qingxupu and said: "Listen to me, everyone, the demands of these troops are not unreasonable. They are even inconsistent with the strike." The workers are no different. I can try to negotiate and contact them on behalf of Qixing, and I will not make the Xian family laugh. Ningguang took a sip of tea and said, "Yu Heng's plan is too bold. I will personally allocate eight divisions as backup." "\nThe "thugs" in Ning Guang's mouth are different from what Ke Qing thought. They still maintain considerable organization and discipline. They are definitely not comparable to a group of striking workers. If they go head-to-head, the casualties will be huge. See These soldiers lined up neatly. Keqing felt that her words were reasonable, but she hoped that they would be willing to sit at the same table with us...\nWhen Keqing first entered the rebel "command headquarters", she heard "We Just want to go home! Why won't you let me pass? "She walked into the headquarters and found that the defense plans of Lishajiao and Yunlaihai were also hung on the wall. In an instant, Keqing knew their intentions. But she could not be afraid and walked straight to the conference room. A The adjutant noticed Ke Qing who came to negotiate, stopped her and said, "You are the representative sent by Qixing, right? The generals are currently in a meeting and it is not convenient for outsiders to enter. Please wait a moment. "Keqing was arranged into a temporary waiting room made of rags and wooden boards, and all tools that could be used to communicate with the outside world were confiscated. This made Keqing feel even more tortured. Time gradually came to night, and when Keqing was almost asleep, she was The adjutant shook him awake roughly: "Don't sleep, the general is waiting for you. "Ke Qing straightened her clothes and quickly entered, only to see several people in military uniforms feasting on dry pot bacon with Jueyun pepper. Ke Qing backed away repeatedly, and the officers noticed that Ke Qing Putting down his chopsticks, one of them said: "You must be the Yuhengxing from Liyue. I didn't expect that our blessings would be enough for Qixing to meet us. Another person handed over a roasted potato and said, "I heard that Master Yuheng likes to eat and live with the soldiers, so I will give the roasted potato to you." "Keqing reluctantly accepted it and expressed her gratitude for the action. During the negotiations, these soldiers bluntly expressed their ambitions for Qixing and even Liyue, but Yu Heng's appeal was considered to be a naive fantasy. When the emotion was extremely emotional, the general still had She drank wine and could only chew potatoes repeatedly to relieve herself. "Negotiations are of no use and they must be eradicated as soon as possible. "Keqing thought to herself as she walked out of the conference room, completely ignoring the "blueprint" that the generals were still drawing.\nKeqing felt aggrieved. She didn't talk about it and was laughed at. She left the command angrily. Ministry, noticed a few soldiers chatting around the campfire, and came up with an idea: "Listen to what they are chatting about, you may gain something unexpected." "She sat quietly next to the soldiers. The night covered her purple hair with a layer of cover, and the similar military uniform prevented her from being recognized quickly. Ke Qing quietly listened to the original words of the soldiers and their families. How she is discriminated against by civilian officials every day, and how she is bullied by military officers... Someone found Ke Qing who was silent and said: "Female soldiers are not allowed to come to the front line in the army, please go back to the logistics." "What female soldier? This is obviously Master Yu Hengxing." "As soon as he said this, several soldiers around him put down their work and gathered around to take a look at Ke Qing's face.\nKe Qing did not show any shyness, and stood up and boldly said something that was not originally planned: "Tianquan. Considering the pain of having your vacation canceled, your family has specially allocated condolence funds to your family. Moreover, your family members have not yet heard about your departure from the station. The purpose of this trip is not to return home, but to Yujingtai; you should not and cannot become meaningless numbers, whether to be used as cannon fodder on the steps or to fight for yourself. It’s up to you! "The soldiers talked a lot after hearing this. Keqing sat down and chatted with the soldiers for a few words before quietly leaving. That night, Keqing's words spread to every mutinous soldier, while the drunken generals were still dreaming. in.\nThe next day, when Keqing wanted to negotiate again, she found that the soldiers at the checkpoint had a completely different attitude towards her than yesterday, and even secretly saluted her. Keqing found that many soldiers had red ribbons on their arms. , when she approached the "command headquarters", she found that it was heavily guarded. When she was confused, a soldier saluted him: "We will keep our troops strong. You must be the purple-haired official who came yesterday." Now that this place is under the control of the Soldiers' Committee, please allow me to explain the situation to you. "Keqing's words last night were like a spark that started a prairie fire. The soldiers led her into the "command headquarters". In a room illuminated by only a few lights, the arrogant officers had dull eyes and were tied up by the soldiers. Unable to move in the chair. Ke Qing was secretly happy that her plan went more smoothly than she imagined.\nShe approached one of the officers, and he turned his head away, his eyes flickering, avoiding Ke Qing's sight. Ke Qing pulled the officer's head Twisting towards her, forcing him to stare at her. She declared her verdict word for word: "I left home to protect the country, and returned to the border because I came home. Qian Yanjun's wish is free from any impurities. And you...tainted it. "\nKeqing opened the holster, pulled out the exquisite pistol, and flipped the safety bolt. \nBang bang - bang - without exception, sent to where they should go. The soldiers raised their arms, The red ribbon gradually merges with the sunset."

 LYY_New_Event.13.d:0"Ke Qing successfully calmed down the follow-up work of the incident, but found that the condolences agreed to be given to his family far exceeded Ke Qing's annual income, and he could not cope with it. In order to avoid breaking his promise, Ke Qing had to seek a solution from Ning Guang Ning Guang looked at the transaction report of Zhu Tian Fang and listened casually to Ke Qing telling her embarrassment. He took a puff of cigarette and said: "Why should we easily agree to something that the country cannot do? If the soldiers of Layer Yan Juyuan mutiny today, If relatives can receive money, who will pay compensation if the soldiers at the gate of Yujingtai mutiny tomorrow? "Ke Qing lowered her head in silence, feeling like she was being laughed at in public. Ningguang put down the report in his hand and said, "It's not impossible for me to come forward to solve the problem, but you see, the house prices in Liyue Port remain high, which affects the funds in the stock market. Turnaround, resolve it within 10 days. \nKe Qing looked at Ningguang playing with the pipe in his hand and thought: "10 days?" It's better to let me declare bankruptcy. "But on the surface, she still reluctantly agreed to Ningguang's mission.\nAfter leaving Qunyu Pavilion, Keqing had no intention of returning to Yujingtai. It was impossible to cover the intricate situation in several sets of data. She walked freely on the street. She wandered around until she heard a familiar voice in Liuli Pavilion. "What a coincidence, Lord Yu Heng!" Hu Tao greeted cordially. "How about having a meal together?" "Keqing saw Zhongli next to Hutao winking at her, and then agreed happily.\nUnlike before, Hutao nodded in agreement to all Zhongli's expenses, and the table was filled with delicious food. "The hall master is in a good mood today. . Is there anything happy? Keqing asked puzzledly. "Yes, every day there are people who enjoy happiness in advance because they can't pay off their mortgages. We at Shengshengtang no longer have to worry about lack of performance!" Hutao clapped his hands and laughed.\nKeqing picked up a piece of matsutake and asked Zhongli, "I wonder if Mr. Zhong has any clever ideas to solve the problem of high real estate prices?" Zhong Li swallowed the food in his mouth and said, "I don't know how Zhong has been able to persuade the Liyue assets headed by Feiyun Chamber of Commerce to do good deeds on his own. Let's eat first." "\n A few people chatted happily while drinking and drinking. But Keqing still didn't understand why securities were more convenient than Mora. Until she saw Zhongli used to wave his hand when checking out: "The account is recorded in the Rebirth Hall. But now he said something like this to the clerk: "Let's pay according to the securities. Use the noon stock as the cut-off point and calculate the discounted price of Mora." "\nZhongli, who had received the receipt, turned to Ke Qing and said, "Master Yuheng is busy with the construction of Liyue, so he should know the benefits of securities to Liyue's economy. Even if he did not agree with the emperor's political instructions, he would not say anything more. "\nZhongli, who was considered a lawful person, made Keqing feel that he was the obstacle to Liyue's reform. At this time, Hutao interjected: "Master Yuheng doesn't usually use securities much. Use it more and you will become familiar with it. . " Then she pulled Zhongli to say goodbye to Keqing. \nAfter having enough wine and food, Keqing decided to go to Wanwen Jishe for a short rest. She sipped her tea slowly and noticed that the passers-by on the street, no matter what the transaction, all treated them in the same way. She settled down with a piece of paper and recalled what Zhongli had just said. At this time, the familiar blue-haired boy sat next to her.\n"Nowadays, securities are used more than Mora, but the old antiques in the Chamber of Commerce are very interested in 'Ningguang' They are not very interested in playing toys, and they cling to their old job. "The young man said to himself.\n"I have a very bad feeling about this. "\n"That's right. The biggest variable in securities trading is that it is only related to the prestige of Master Tianquan. Once the authority of heaven is irreversible, the consequences will be unimaginable. Whether it is the idle immortals or the foreign countries who covet Liyue's wealth, they have left indelible wounds on the people of Liyue. "\nThe two chatted for a long time, and it wasn't until the lanterns came on that Ke Qing said goodbye to Xingqiu..."

Walking through the streets in Qingqing, you catch a glimpse of a man in a dimly lit alley in the distance. She ran inside, but there was no movement after a round of intensive gunfire. Curiosity drove Ke Qing to go over and take a look, but Xi Baiyi suddenly covered her eyes and her mouth was covered by a hand. She felt When a woman said in her ear: "Don't look at things you shouldn't see, and don't listen to things you shouldn't hear. The same goes for everyone, including Qixing." "After Keqing heard Ye Lan's voice, she nodded stiffly. After a while, the world turned around, the white clothes and the woman disappeared in the night air, leaving only a trace mark.\nLiyue, where the rule of man was at its peak, could be like this Means, are Ningguang's hands still pure? Keqing, who is well aware of Yelan's work style, thinks about it and knows that Ningguang will kill herself. Keqing recalled the people and things that happened during the day, and decided to find a rescue solution from Zhongli.\nThe Hall of Rebirth is one of the most taboo places for people in Liyue, and Keqing is no exception. But she knew that there was her hope. She went to the side door as usual and signaled to the people inside with a "dong dong dong" sound. She wanted to The necessary response came quickly, “Ouch, business is coming! "A lively female voice came from inside, accompanied by footsteps getting closer and closer. "Hall Master, wait a moment. "The mature male voice prevented further action, "Based on common sense, the person who came here did not deliver the wooden sign, and he probably had other entrustments. "\nThe side door opened a small crack. Keqing saw the girl's expectant face, frowned and whispered: "Hutao, I'm here to see Mr. Zhongli, not a client. "Hu Tao was a little depressed, but still let Keqing enter.\nZhongli seemed to expect there would be a party. The teapot on the table was scattered with Qingxin flower petals and some Guiliyuan shortcakes. "What's the importance of Mr. Yuheng's visit late at night? Something? Keqing sat on a chair and drank tea nervously: "Mr. Zhongli, the task of regulating housing prices that I mentioned today is no longer an impossible task. What are your countermeasures?" "\nZhongli sipped tea: "If you have done something, you will not lose it; if you have not done it, you will not be able to do it." Now Tianquanxing is extending its influence to the whole country of Liyue, and at the same time planting the seeds of crisis. "\nHe stood up from his chair, took out a copy of the "Yangang Evening News" and spread it in front of Ke Qing. On the front page it read, "The Immortal Spy has recently had traces of activity in Qingce Village."\n Ke Qing felt in his heart He breathed a sigh of relief. Zhongli pointed to the headline and said: "I know that in the past, your lord's heroic spirit was used to kidnap the imperial convicts at Yuehai Pavilion, but these alone cannot deal with the intrigues of Liyue Port. Now, lord, you need to preserve your strength. Keqing suddenly realized it and thanked Zhongli: "Sir's words are like enlightenment, but Tianquan's eyes are all over Liyue, how can I be accommodated?" "\n"Ms. Keqing, do you have a map with you? Zhongli suddenly asked. Ke Qing nodded, took out the scroll he carried with him and said, "This is a simple diagram I use for general project construction, but it is enough." "I saw two people pointing at the engineering drawings. Zhongli pointed lightly at the village: "Although this is the hub of the northern border of Liyue, it is too far away from Liyue Port, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Then he looked at Jueyunjian and said in deep thought: "This is a place for immortals to practice. Even though it has the benefits of industry and mining, it will send people to live in exile." Keqing looked at Qingxupu and said, "I once put down a mutiny. Is this place suitable for use?" Zhongli shook his head and put the tea cup here: "Lisha suburb is adjacent to the layer rock black rock factory, which is where Liyue was founded. Ningguang will definitely wipe out the rebels who are separatist here, and it is not suitable to cause trouble." Keqing said thoughtfully: "Where is the real promised land?" Is it the Guiliyuan with its vast thoroughfares or the isolated Guyun Pavilion hanging overseas? Zhongli handed a piece of shortbread to Keqing's hand: "As you said, Gui Li originally lived in Liyue." Ningguang's execution ability is not very strong and has a certain foundation. The railway chaired by an adult will also facilitate movement. "While the two were talking, Hutao walked in. He took the shortbread in Keqing's hand and ate it: "Keqing is going to Guiliyuan? That's a place my father often takes me to, and I still have some acquaintances there who can help you. How about it? "Putting on a look that wants to be affirmed. "It seems that there is already a clue. The order that has been maintained for thousands of years is no longer suitable for Liyue. The time for change has come. Do you want to set off with me? " \nNine days later, Keqing was dismissed from her position at Yuhengxing because she could not settle the housing price incident, but she was not sad. Because at Liyue Gangbei Railway Station, a new story was written..."

It was so destructive that the achievements of Ningguang's governance were wiped out in an instant. The storm also quickly spread to Guiliyuan, causing labor shortages in small cities. To make matters worse. Ke Qing worked incognito at the radio station, reporting on the chaos that was happening all over Liyue. Ningguang's rescue and stability plans failed again and again. She knew clearly that the time had come.\nIn Zhongli and Under Xingqiu's gaze, she turned on the radio. "Good evening to everyone from Liyuan to Quan Liyue. Welcome to today's broadcast. As of 18:00 tonight, Wuwangpo, Shimen, and Mingyun Town have temporarily lost contact with Liyue Port. Listeners who want to go to Mondstadt in the near future need to postpone their plans; according to Yujing Station, Lord Tianquan directs various economies in Liyue The organization achieved a staged victory, and Zhi Dong Capital fled. Prices will rise slightly in the near future, and the economy will recover in an orderly manner..." Keqing's heart bleeds as she read the manuscript that was contrary to reality, and her eyes couldn't stop rolling. She decided that she could no longer swallow her anger, "Hello everyone, I am the former Yuhengxing, carved clear. I appeal to all those who care deeply about our country's history, and all those who think seriously about its future. Please don’t let false news obscure your eyes from exploring true knowledge, take a look around you! How many people are homeless and homeless because they cannot repay their loans; how many people are deprived of food and clothing because of the lack of Mora. "\n" Please think about it, who is the person who caused Liyue to sink into such a situation? Unfortunately, it was the emperor who personally eliminated the Liyue Seven Star Group headed by Tianquanxing. They didn't care about Liyue's widowed and lonely situation, but Mora threw herself into a bottomless pit with only a small amount of money to put out the fire, and personally destroyed Liyue, who had been protected by the emperor for thousands of years..." Ke Qing choked up when she said this, and tears welled up in her eyes." Comrades and friends, are we willing to see Liyue languish like this? No! We have no room for concession anymore. We must take action. This is not to make Liyue an enemy, nor to gain benefits for ourselves in any form. Instead, there is an urgent need to find a way to save the country, a way to get rid of depression and eliminate poverty. It needs a brand new road that is not under the control of Ningguang and the threat of the Yelan secret police. Therefore, we need to devote our limited lives to the unlimited liberation of the people of Liyue. To establish a free and democratic republic that truly belongs to the people! "Keqing had just turned off the radio station and found that many people had gathered downstairs. Xingqiu hurriedly went downstairs to check the news. Keqing followed closely behind him and found that they were moved by Keqing's words of serving the country wholeheartedly and volunteered to build a ladder to push Keqing. Arriving at the door of Guiliyuan City Hall, there was a sea of jubilation at the foot of the steps, and a podium that had been prepared for a speech. She could not restrain her inner feelings and shouted: "Comrades, the great journey has just begun. We need to liberate our destiny from the hands of Ningguang! Liyue Seven Stars Revolutionary Committee was officially established! ""

Soon, the problem of population shortage in Guiliyuan has been solved.\nAfter solving the population aspect, Keqing needs to Thinking about how to make good use of these people? Xingqiu and Zhongli have different opinions. From an economic point of view, Xingqiu believes that the current population is saturated, and these people can be mobilized into the army to protect the people's revolutionary fruits; Zhongli considers These people have not long arrived in Guiliyuan and are not very attached to the committee. If they rush to join the army or become administrators, they may disrupt order. It is proposed that these people join the team that builds Guiliyuan. Keqing was silent and finally decided: "

Although he works overtime every day, he will not show exhaustion; now all departments of the Seven Star Revolutionary Committee need to Ke Qing According to the review, Ke Qing often worked overtime until early in the morning, but it did not necessarily solve the problems of the day. One ugly day, Ke Qing was still planning how to reduce the losses in the civil war and build New Liyue, and suddenly fainted and lay on the ground for no apparent reason. Ke Qing made a A real and fantastic dream. She was walking in the forest of Guiliyuan in her party clothes. At first, the trees were prosperous and the road was narrow enough for only one person to pass. After walking a few steps, she suddenly saw an ancient pavilion standing in it. There was a table in the pavilion. One stove, one woman, roasted tea on the stove, and chess on the table. The woman was not surprised when she saw Keqing arriving, but instead invited Keqing to play chess. She saw "Liyue Millennium" Keqing played several times, and found that the woman The man was making his arrangements in a leisurely manner, but he was in a hurry and neglected the overall layout. Ke Qing was deeply surprised, so he asked the woman about the mystery. The woman calmly made Ke Qing a cup of tea, and Ke Qing Qing keenly discovered that the glazed lily in the teacup was exactly the same as her headdress. \nKe Qing took a sip of tea and said, "Few people in Liyue make tea with glazed lily now. Although the taste is unique, it is a gluttonous thing. "The woman smiled and said nothing. When she saw the identity of the Seven Stars on her body, she filled the tea again. Ke Qing added: "The immortal has protected you for thousands of years. Today's Liyue is very different, and people need changes. But the immortals are resistant to change, and there are also many resistances within Qixing. Am I wrong? The woman picked off a petal and put it in Keqing's hand: "Your actions may not be wrong, and they may not be right either." Change takes time, and we should not hesitate to move forward due to temporary setbacks. "Ke Qing smelled the fragrance of glazed lilies on the woman's body, recalled reading the description of the death of the dust god in a book when she was a child, and continued: "Today's Lord Tianquan is focused on attracting investment regardless of the current situation, and ignores the native land of Liyue. develop. Only a few people in Liyue are rich because of this. Is this what you want to see, Lord Gui Zhong? After all, he drank the tea in the cup in one gulp, hid his face and said with a smile: "I didn't expect that I can't hide it from you, girl, but I can't answer your question directly." Keqing asked again: "Do you know that glass lilies used to be all over the mountains and plains in Guiliyuan, but now the endangered plant is only planted in a small amount in Liyue Port, and how should it be dealt with?" Finally, he kissed Keqing's forehead and said, "You only need to sign a contract with me, and then the problems will no longer be difficult." "Finally, I took out a piece of paper with a flick of my sleeves - "Gui Liyuan and Liuli Lily" and left. When Ke Qing wanted to say a few more words, she found herself in the hospital. She saw the starry sky outside the window faded and the sun was rising. You will know the picture."

Yunge Fortress decorates Liyue Port; now, Liyue's neighboring countries Fontaine, Daozuma, and Mondstadt are all developing maritime affairs. The Southern Cross Fleet supported by Ningguang has become prominent, and it has become the highest paid soldier after the Military Control Council. A place. Under the dark shadow of the moon, the Southern Cross Fleet is struggling. Can the "Ningguang Hairpin" rest in glory?\nOn the Jade Pavilion, Ningguang is in a daze looking at the withered and decaying flower beds outside the window.\n"Tianquan Sir, Miss Beidou is here. "\n Without waiting for Ningguang's response, the captain walked into the office. She looked at the woman in front of her in surprise. How could this look like a "natural power"? The hairpin was simply fixed on her hair and almost fell off. His face was full of sadness, his military uniform was full of wrinkles, and he was holding a smoking gun in his hand. He didn't look like a qualified leader at all.\n"Ningguang, I can't see you looking high-spirited. "Beidou couldn't help but said.\n"I can't see it either. "Ningguang raised his head and glanced at Beidou, then coughed violently. For a moment, the dirty smoke filled the air, causing the captain to cover his mouth and nose. "Wow, what are you doing? "\nNingguang waved his hand, signaling Beidou not to ask further questions, and then said, "If you have anything to say, just tell me. "\n"Hmm...Okay. "She scratched the back of her head in embarrassment: "Now there are not so many caravans to protect, and there are so many brothers to support, so..." Ningguang took a breath full of smoke and stood holding on to the back of the chair. She stood up and fiddled with the hanging painting behind her. Beidou noticed that all the valuables on her body were missing. A large bag of mora fell to the ground from the gap in the hanging painting, which instantly alerted the secretaries at the door. Beidou shouted: "Get out of here." ! Then he watched Ning Guang pick up the bag tremblingly and hand it to Beidou, and said angrily: "Take it, this is the last money I have as Ning Guang." Maybe alleviate the urgent need. Beidou was unwilling to accept it: "What would you do if I took it away?" Ning Guang forced out a smile: "I don't need it." "She pushed the bag to the captain who also looked haggard. After some hesitation, she accepted it. "I can't ask for your things in vain. Is there anything I can do to help you? After a long while, Ningguang slowly said: "Can I lean on your shoulder?" Beidou nodded and opened his hands.\nThere was no sound when Ningguang cried, but Beidou could feel her tears flowing down her cheeks in strings, moistening her shoulders. The captain patted Ningguang gently. Her back was the same as it was twenty years ago. Over the years, Beidou had never seen such a fragile Ningguang. In her eyes, Ningguang had always been synonymous with "strong". She remained silent and just said The woman in his arms hugged her a little tighter, giving her some long-lost warmth.\nAfter a long time, Ningguang gently broke away from Beidou's arms and returned to his original appearance: "It's better not to meet here again in the future . "Beidou couldn't bear to see Ningguang's demoralization anymore, so he had to agree. Looking at Beidou's back gradually blurring, Ningguang couldn't help but burst into tears. As the door of Qunyu Pavilion closed, Beidou saw that Qunyu Pavilion, which was once the top of Liyue, had already disappeared. She did not look down on the world. She walked to Liyue South Military Port in a daze. The crew noticed that Beidou's demeanor had dissipated the remaining optimism. Beidou took off his blindfold and handed it to the fleet accountant: "Take this. Blindfold, go to the Liyue bank and take out my money and give it to the brothers. The Southern Cross story may be coming to an end. Maplehara Manyo dropped the leaf in his hand and said to Beidou: "How could the giant ship of the Southern Cross abandon the ship because it ran aground for a while? All the brothers are willing to continue to follow the eldest sister." "The ideal is lofty, but realizing it is difficult. The Southern Cross Fleet finally abandoned most of the ships, leaving only the Death Star, Beidou, Manyo and hundreds of crew members. They wandered the sea aimlessly, looking for a place to stay. Land. I heard that the price of supplies in Guiliyuan was much lower than that in surrounding areas. The Southern Cross Lone Star brought their only remaining Mora to Guiliyuan, and it was indeed as the rumors said. "Beidou? How come you are here? "Xingqiu was surprised by the arrival of Beidou Wanye, but what was even more unexpected was that he could still recognize the appearance of Beidou and Wanye. \nUnder the leadership of Xingqiu, Beidou changed Guiliyuan and even the entire Liyue. Xingqiu attributed the many changes in Guiliyuan to the people of Liyue. Beidou vaguely revealed the situation of the Southern Cross Fleet, and Xingqiu also directly asked Keqing and Beidou to meet. Keqing came from Liyue Port In particular, the people around Ningguang were not friendly at first, and even a little wary. Keqing took the numbers in his hand and changed them again and again, and finally said to Beidou: "Actually, I can't afford such a fleet, and there is no need to worry about the sky." Quan's crimes will not budge. Hearing this, Beidou knelt down with a plop and said to Keqing with sparkling tears: "No matter how many Mora there are in troubled times, we can't survive, let alone we are the same people of Liyue." I, Beidou Piaoling, have not asked for help for several years. Today, I beg Master Yuheng to spare Ningguang's life. She will not die for her crime. "Just like Beidou looking at the condensed light in Qunyu Pavilion, Keqing has never seen Beidou in such a fragile state. Wanye was crying aside, and Xingqiu wanted to help Beidou.\nThe frosty morning moon, the sound of horse hooves breaking, He swallowed loudly. Keqing lifted Beidou up and wiped away the tears. Similar to Gan Yu, he said to Xingqiu: The surrender of the Southern Cross Fleet will be decided by the committee. Let Beidou Sister Tou and Manyo brothers go to rest first. They It had been some days since they had eaten enough.\nIn the end, the Revolutionary Committee welcomed Southern Cross very much and sent people to Guyun Pavilion, the home port of the fleet, to receive it. The situation between Ningguang and Keqing had completely changed! One day In the early morning, Keqing had a conversation with Manyo, the core content of which was: "
 LYY_New_Event.18.a:0 "Today I have a long tassel in my hand, when will I bind the power of heaven?"
 LYY_New_Event.18.b:0 "Sweeping through thousands of armies like a rolling mat, how can we even complain at every step!"
 LYY_New_Event.19.t:0"March to Liyue Port"
 LYY_New_Event.19.d:0" "Lord Keqing, the latest information is that Ningguang's troops have escaped and very few of them are left, and there is a gap in the defense line of Liyue Port. "Maplehara Manyo handed over the latest investigation report to Keqing.\n"Good news! Thank you for your hard work, Manyo. "Ke Qing couldn't hide her excitement, and her voice couldn't help but rise a few degrees. "Immediately prepare for Red October. Now, as long as we are on the verge of closing the door, the corrupt and corrupt regime will collapse, and Liyue, which truly belongs to the people, will coming! "\nThe order to launch a general attack was quickly issued. An hour later, the armored train "Red October" was ready for departure at the train station in Guiliyuan. Countless people were crowded outside the station, vying to see this black dragon. Afterwards, he was overwhelmed by its 16-section huge body, the large and small artillery and terminal machines all over the body, and the terrifying 280mm train gun. Ke Qing inspected hundreds of people on the platform. The soldiers fighting alongside her boarded the train. Following her order, the steel behemoth exhaled thick black smoke, broke through all obstacles and moved forward slowly under the whine of the whistle. At the front, there was a huge red rock The elemental symbol is particularly eye-catching.\nThe movement of the "Red October" was already known to Ning Guang when it just set off. She hurriedly ordered the fortresses along the railway to concentrate firepower to destroy it and blow up the rails so that the train could not pass. But Ning Guang Guang was horrified to find that all ambush attacks on it would be reduced to dust under the powerful firepower of the armored train, unable to damage it at all, and the strong defenses of the fortress would be forcibly knocked open by the giant cannon. What made her even more desperate was However, even if the rails are blown up, it can only slightly delay the progress of the "Red October", because the railway workers organized themselves and repaired the rails at an incredible speed.\nThe next night, "Red October" "" has arrived at the Tianquan Fortress. This fortress named after Ningguang is the last line of defense in Liyue Port, so the defense here is particularly tight. Anyone who wants to break through this fortress will inevitably die. Ke Qing knows very well that if There was little chance of winning in a head-to-head confrontation between the train and her own troops, and she spent the whole night thinking about how to defeat the enemy without fighting. When she was at a loss, she decided to go up to the roof of the train to relax. Keqing sat on the top of the turret at the front of the train, looking around with a telescope Looking around, she soon discovered anomalies: sporadic firelight appeared around the fortress on the top of the mountain, gunshots were heard in the distance, and the huge coastal defense turret was motionless. What happened? She was confused and ordered the train Stop and wait and see what happens. After about an hour, the fire dissipated, a red flag was raised, and the soldiers in the fortress rose up. The "Red October" was able to pass through the defensive gate unscathed and march to Liyue Port. Finally, the obstacle was eliminated. \nOn the Tianquan Fortress, the train gun aimed its huge muzzle at Yujing Terrace. This night, history will be made. "Master Keqing, the artillery has entered the predetermined position, and is ready to fire at Zhu Yuan Complete and awaiting your orders. "Manye reported to Keqing.\n"Very good. So, let’s set off the fireworks of revolution! "\nWith the dazzling firelight and deafening roar, a cannon was ejected from the barrel, crossing a red track in the night sky of Liyue Port, and then blooming dazzlingly in the sky - the world will always remember this sound. A cannon shot that made history."
 LYY_New_Event.19.a:0"Liyue workers and peasants truly liberated themselves"
 LYY_New_Event.20.t:0"The Fall of Tianquan"
 LYY_New_Event.20.d:0" Ningguang slumped on the chair, looking ahead with empty eyes. Everything was over, and any resistance was meaningless. Beidou blocked the Liyue port from the sea to prevent speculators from escaping by chance; Zhongli descended from Tianheng Mountain and landed, and the Liyue Transitional Government could no longer issue any orders. The only thing she could do now was to wait for her outcome. She looked at her appearance in the mirror, and immediately turned her head away. She knew that she would no longer be able to look like the Tianquan Star.\nNingguang didn't need to wait long. After an hour, a group of soldiers rushed open the door and surrounded her. Then, a purple-haired woman walked in, He walked up to her and spoke slowly: "Tianquan, you have failed. "\nAs if she had gained relief, Ningguang showed a bitter smile to her former colleagues."
 LYY_New_Event.20.a:0""Yeah, I lost. ""
 LYY_New_Event.21.t:0"If the sky is sentimental, the sky will also grow old"
 LYY_New_Event.21.d:0" Ke Qing sat in the plaintiff's dock and looked at Ning Guang, who was curled up in the defendant's dock. Her haggard face had long lost its look, leaving only sadness and fear. Ning Guang's cloudy red eyes Eyes locked with Keqing's, she knew very well that the prisoner was begging for her mercy. Even Beidou, who was known for his toughness, was sobbing in the auditorium, and her deputy was comforting her softly beside her.\n"Everyone stand up, The defendant Ningguang... According to the 'General Principles of the Liyue Civil Code'..." The judge read out the drafted document expressionlessly, and the Beidou tissue became wet. "He was sentenced to 12 months of reform through labor. If he does not obey the sentence, he can appeal again. "The judge knocked the gavel three times. Ningguang sat there motionless in a daze. She couldn't believe her ears. She pinched her thigh, and the immediate pain showed that she was not dreaming. Ningguang was The moment he was brought out of Qunyu Pavilion, he thought that his relationship with Ke Qing was destined to die, but the sound of interpretation shattered Ning Guang's fantasy. Ke Qing stood up from his seat: "People are not emotionless money-making machines, please Comrade Ningguang cherishes this opportunity. "Ningguang raised his head without saying a word. The moment he was taken away by the bailiff, he smiled at Ke Qing for a long time."
 LYY_New_Event.21.a:0"Fight to liberate yourself"
 LYY_New_Event.22.t:0"The right path in the world is the vicissitudes of life"
 LYY_New_Event.22.d:0" Ye Lan sat in the defendant's seat with disdain on her face, ignoring the gaze of the plaintiff Xi Keqing. As the judge read out the verdict one by one, she remained silent and fiddled with herself silently. Slightly faded dice.\n"The defendant Ye Lan,...according to the Liyue Criminal Code...was sentenced to three years and four months in prison. If he does not obey the sentence, he can appeal at an optional date. Yelan stood up from her seat and said, "Ningguang is still too weak." If it were me, you wouldn't even have time to repent of your sins. What court? It's just a drama for Keqing to attract power. "She looked directly at Keqing, her green eyes also judging her. If looks could kill, Keqing would have been cut into pieces by a thousand knives. Yelan gritted her teeth and said word by word: "I regret... I regret that time I shouldn’t hesitate to kill you! "Ke Qing swallowed down the anger in her heart and said to Ye Lan:"
 LYY_New_Event.22.a:0""War changes a person""
 LYY_New_Event.23.t:0"Red and Black"
 LYY_New_Event.23.d:0" Keqing opened the heavy cell door. The prisoner inside was handcuffed and shackled, and tied to a bench behind her back. She was very angry, and her joints made a clicking sound, but her reason told her to Calm down. She walked up to Ye Lan and asked through gritted teeth: "Did you hang Gan Yu on that torture rack? "\n"So what? The woman with aqua-blue hair sneered, and said with utmost sarcasm, "Not only that, I also interrogated her myself." Is this expected? "Before she finished speaking, the bench beneath her turned into a pile of wooden bars, and she fell on the floor. The nightmare began.\nA rubber stick appeared in Ke Qing's hand. "Gan Yu also experienced the pain he suffered. Just give it a try. "\nYelan couldn't see Keqing's movements clearly, but her body responded honestly. There was a burning pain in her elbows, thighs, back, and abdomen. This was a piece of cake for Yelan. She She closed her eyes and enjoyed the strange pleasure brought by the pain. Keqing gave her a contemptuous look. \n"Uh--!" "There was an extremely sharp stabbing pain in her lower abdomen, which was so painful that Ye Lan opened her eyes and curled up her body. She coughed out a mouthful of blood and gasped heavily, while Ke Qing's foot still stepped on her lower abdomen.\n" Do you know what pain is? "\nThe next nightmare began. Ke Qing's next kick hit her ribs, then her stomach, then her private parts, and then her spine. In comparison, the blows from the rubber stick could be described as gentle. . Yelan couldn't help but scream in pain, rolling on the ground, trying to avoid the punches and kicks, but this was of no use except adding to Keqing's anger, and more punches and kicks fell on her body. Ling Yelan What was even more frightening was that she could not lose consciousness under the endless punches and kicks. It was not until an unknown amount of time later that she fell motionless like a sack of potatoes on the stone slab of the cell. Someone came in to test her pulse and test her nerves. To react, he rolled her eyelids, touched her body with rough fingers to see if any bones were broken, and injected an injection into her arm to make her fall asleep."
 LYY_New_Event.23.a:0 "Purple and blue, extending infinitely in a closed space."
 LYY_New_Event.24.t:0"The beginning and end of reincarnation"
 LYY_New_Event.24.d:0" Ye Lan woke up in the darkness and immediately understood her condition. She was fixed on the bed and a ball was stuffed in her mouth. Years of work experience have trained her to listen in the dark. With the ability to distinguish the position of the voice, she could hear the friction of high heels against the floor from a distance, and the "clang" of the iron door opening and closing.\nThe visitor tore off Ye Lan's blindfold, and the sudden light made her unable to open her eyes. Zi The woman with the hair came into Ye Lan's sight first. Later, the ball was removed, and Ke Qing looked at her breathing heavily with a playful look. "Are you comfortable? "There was a meter under her hand with a lever on it and a circle of numbers on the surface of the meter. \nYe Lan tried to move her hand, but as expected it didn't move at all. "That's all. "\nKeqing's hand moved slightly, and then without any warning, Yelan felt a sharp pain spread throughout her body. The pain was daunting. This was a pain she had never felt before. Although she felt very enjoyable, her body Still twitching uncontrollably, beads of sweat on her forehead soaked her hair. Ye Lan gritted her teeth to keep from making a sound. \n "Oh? Is this the limit? Ke Qing chuckled and said, "These methods are much gentler than your torture of prisoners." "Ye Lan looked back at Ke Qing, but she couldn't say a word in pain. \n Ke Qing pulled the lever back, and the labor pain subsided quickly, as fast as when it happened. "It's forty now, and this meter can have a maximum of one Hundred, in short, your life and death are in my hands. During our conversation, if you act mysterious or deaf, I will make you scream in pain. \nDo you understand? "No one can dig out even a little bit of information from Ye Lan's mouth.\n"You should reflect on why you are so incompetent and want me to say a word. You are still too young. "Ye Lan wanted to turn her head, but was fixed by the chain. Ke Qing snorted coldly: "We'll see. You will regret this. "\n"Answer me, did you concoct the Yuethai Pavilion case? "Ke Qing asked the question.\nYelan didn't bother to answer at all, and then there was a sharp pain, and the pointer on the meter turned to fifty-five. She broke into a cold sweat, as if her life would end in the next second. Even if she gave No matter how many psychological hints she gave, Yelan couldn't hold it back. Keqing pulled the lever back, but the severe pain only eased slightly. "Said. "Ye Lan still didn't say a word.\nThe pointer turned to sixty, sixty-five, and seventy. Ye Lan opened her eyes and closed them suddenly, trying to divert the pain. The pain became more severe, but even so, she still didn't say a word Mention. However, as the thunder element continued to erode every inch of Yelan's body, she could no longer hold on for long.\nYelan suddenly screamed, and then closed her eyes. The huge electric shock made Yelan feel trance-like. In the middle of the ice field, the wind is freezing. Yelan wants to curl up to keep warm, but her body cannot move. Tears and saliva flow uncontrollably. Yelan wants to embrace the warmth and be cared for. Keqing also releases the lever just in time to hug her. Yelan. At that moment, the pain was external, coming from other sources. Only Keqing would save her from the pain. But as her consciousness returned to her body, she felt a chill towards the woman holding her. Yelan She shook her body and tried to break away from Keqing's arms. She was disgusted with the woman in front of her who had beaten her up.\n"Be good. "Keqing's voice sounded from her ears, and the pain subsided. "Don't be afraid, just say it. "\n"It's...it's Ningguang...she...she ordered me to do it..." Ye Lan responded inarticulately.\n"It's really unfortunate. Keqing shook her head and said softly: "Bad boys who lie will be punished~ Come again." "\nThe shackles on Ye Lan's body tightened again, and she felt another pain, which made her close her eyes tightly. The pointer probably rose to eighty or ninety. She could only remember intermittently why it hurt so much, and her consciousness seemed to be dissipating. .\n"Who is it?" "\n"Only...there is...me. ”\n“Better. So good. "A needle pierced Ye Lan's arm, and the pain dissipated in an instant, and warmth spread all over her body. She opened her eyes and looked at Ke Qing with tears in her eyes. Ye Lan had never been so in love with the woman in front of her, not only because she stopped Despite her own pain, there was also a strange feeling brewing in her heart. \nTwo slightly moist pads clamped Ye Lan's temples. She shrank and felt a little pain, but it was completely different from before. Ke Qing He put his hand on the back of her hand and reassured her with a kind tone.\n"There will be no pain this time. "Ke Qing said. "Keep your eyes on me. "\nThen there was an explosion. Although there was no sound, Yelan felt a flash of light that made her unable to open her eyes. This time there was indeed no harm, it just made her fall asleep."
 LYY_New_Event.24.a:0"Just get some sleep"
 LYY_New_Event.25.t:0"Who am I"
 LYY_New_Event.25.d:0"Yelan was handcuffed to a chair again. However, the management has been loosened recently, and she has a certain amount of time every day to move freely. The appearance no longer scares Yelan, in Keqing's description , it was a tool to punish bad children. It was probably because her brain was not working well at that time, and Ke Qing was kindly reminding her. Ye Lan can’t remember how long their conversation lasted, it might have been a few weeks, or it might have been a few. Months.\nYelan told everything without reservation. Whether it was Gan Yu's false testimony or the assassination of Ningguang's opponents, she confessed everything to Keqing. She found it difficult to refuse to respond. Ke Qing’s problem. Whenever this thought appeared in her mind, there would be a strong force to suppress it. Later, it would never appear again. In addition, when she heard Ke Qing’s high heels She always felt excited by the sound of friction with the floor, so that her lower body was a little wet - Ke Qing's presence made her feel very comfortable. \nThe iron door opened again, and Ke Qing walked in, noticing Ye Lan's eagerness With a look in his eyes, he sat in front of her with a smile on his face and started a new round of questioning. Ye Lan talked endlessly about his past experiences. Ke Qing nodded repeatedly and touched her head from time to time to express approval. It’s as if this is not an interrogation, but a conversation between friends.\n“So good. "After the interrogation, Ke Qing stood up and kissed Ye Lan on the cheek. "Good children should be rewarded. Stand up. "The shackles that restrained Ye Lan opened in response. She grabbed the hand that Ke Qing extended to her and wanted to get up, but found that her legs were completely unable to use the strength due to being fixed on the chair for a long time. She fell down as soon as she straightened her back. On the ground. Yelan raised her head and looked up at Keqing's face as if she were looking up to a god. Using her hands and feet, she slowly wriggled to Keqing's side and printed a word full of reverence and love on the delicately decorated golden tips of her high heels. Kiss and lick the remaining blood stains that have solidified on it.\n"Pa" Keqing snapped her fingers, sat on the chair where Ye Lan had just sat, and stretched her feet in front of Ye Lan. "As a reward, I May you do what you expect. "\nYelan's eyes suddenly shone, and she held Keqing's jade feet in her hands like a child who got candy. She lowered her head and carefully took off the high-heeled shoes as if she were unpacking them. She pinched one of them with both hands and gently touched it with the tip of her tongue. Touching lightly, the touch of the toes couldn't help but make Keqing moan. Yelan bit into the stockings, Keqing touched Yelan's forehead and said: "You are really impatient...ah" Yelan put her whole toe in her mouth In the mouth, the wet mouth and itchy toes made Ke Qing moan involuntarily, and then released her teasingly. The silver thread around her mouth was still stuck to the toes. Yelan's dexterous tongue was on Ke Qing's toes. Wandering, slowly moving to her ankles, she retracted her feet. Her green eyes suddenly dimmed, and she lowered her head pitifully.\nKe Qing looked at Yelan who was kneeling on the ground with unfinished thoughts, and spoke in the tone of a parent. Asked: "Ye Lan, who am I? ""
