 Teyvat.2.d:0 "Legend has it that after the War of the Demons and Gods, human civilisation slowly revived under the protection of the gods, who then established the Island of the Sky, where a fairy god named Tenri is the supreme ruler for the continent of Teyvat over the Seven Rulers of the Earthly Realms.500 years ago, when the Twins of the Otherworldly Worlds wanted to leave Teyvat, it was Tenri that prevented them from doing so. She put an end to the usurpation of the Son of Man, sealed him, and led the gods and armies of the Seven Kingdoms of Tivat to overthrow the miraculous land of mankind, Kanya. And now, she will blow the horn of war again, vowing to cleanse the dust of the earth. In the face of the challenge of Tenri, our beloved Fourth Heavenly Tribulation is likely to become the enemy of Tenri, and certainly the guide of Tenri. This meeting of Tenri has both challenges and opportunities, make your choice!"

 Yuehai_Kiosk_Turmoil_desc:0 "The seven stars of the Lunar Moon represent the direction in which the Lunar Moon is moving forward, but the situation in the Lunar Moon under the rule of the Yujingtai and the seven stars after the Emperor's passing is complicated and often contradictory. This twisted situation divides into two dominant factions, though each is reluctant to cut off Riyue. As a result the factions argue over economic construction, military reform and even public opinion campaigns, amassing more favourable resources for themselves. If one day Riyue falls into turmoil, they will do whatever it takes to seize the leadership of Riyue."
