 DRA_Accelerate_Redistribution_desc:0 "In the process of economic development in Dragonspine, we have noticed that the wealth gap in society is widening.

 DRA_More_Powerful_Economy:0 "Stimulating economic vitality"
 DRA_More_Powerful_Economy_desc:0 "Our previous economic construction has benefited all sectors of the Dragonspine, resulting in a significant increase in people's income. However, people are afraid of the risks brought by civil war and often choose to save their income.

 DRA_Up_our_Confidence:0 "Boost people's confidence"
 DRA_Up_our_Confidence_desc:0 "Long lasting peace makes people afraid of war and do not believe that we can gain an advantage in war, which will bring us great disadvantages in future wars.

 DRA_Trial_of_Sucrose:0 "Sucrose's Attempt"
 DRA_Trial_of_Sucrose_desc:0 "Although this is indeed the will of the people, Miss Sucrose, at least for now, is not a qualified leader. After all, she has almost no administrative experience - but at least, she has a strong learning ability, a willingness to change herself, and a desire to serve the people. Now she has attempted to take over his power under Albedo's guidance and carry out actions to address the current situation. In order to achieve her goal, she came to the office of a senior executive"
 DRA_For_Peoples_Bread:0 "For people's bread"
 DRA_For_Peoples_Bread_desc:0 "The food supply problem in Dragonspine has threatened social stability, and now we can see swollen and hungry people on the streets. We should first deal with this situation to prevent it from deteriorating irretrievably. In the words of Miss Sucrose, a government that watches the people starve to death will not gain the trust of the people."
 DRA_Radical_Agricultural_Innovation:0 "Radical Agricultural Innovation"
 DRA_Radical_Agricultural_Innovation_desc:0 "At this moment, Miss Sucrose's past achievements have taken effect\: her cold resistant crops have harvested abundantly, becoming an important part of government relief. In the past, some people believed that food and crops produced through biological alchemy had unknown risks and should not be promoted too quickly. However, now, for the sake of the people's stomachs, perhaps we need to take this risk and apply Miss Sucrose's achievements and ingenuity to various aspects of food production."
 DRA_Sucrose_Nutrition_Liquid:0 "Sucrose's Nutritional Cream"
 DRA_Sucrose_Nutrition_Liquid_desc:0 "We will focus on promoting Miss Sucrose's latest masterpiece - a \"nutritional cream\" that can be made from things that humans cannot eat, such as straw and grass. It is not only cost-effective and convenient to manufacture, but also has a delicious taste, undoubtedly a major help to solve our current problems. \n However, it looks really ugly, even a bit disgusting, just like a bunch of Slimes. If we want the people to accept it, we must make them have enough acceptance of these strange new things through propaganda."
 DRA_Buy_Food:0 "Purchase external grains"
 DRA_Buy_Food_desc:0 "We will purchase a large amount of grain from Liyue and develop conventional agriculture at the same time, ensuring current food supply while also ensuring future food supply through agricultural development. Miss Sucrose received this opinion from Mr. Albedo, and if she chose to do so, she would have to rush around in conversations with the merchant from Liyue. Her creative ideas may be postponed - so many officials support this method."
 DRA_Relief_Agencies:0 "Establishing relief agencies"
 DRA_Relief_Agencies_desc:0 "Simply pouring a large amount of food into the market to lower food prices is not enough. We must see those who lost their jobs and homes during the Mondstadt Civil War and were already penniless - this is the original words of Miss Sucrose. We will recruit those who have the ability to work and allow them to participate in engineering construction to receive labor remuneration; Those who are confirmed to be unable to work can enter the relief agency and drink hot congee in a warm room to prevent them from freezing to death in the cold Dragonspine."
 DRA_Chicken_Came_Back:0 "Embrace the chicken leg"
 DRA_Chicken_Came_Back_desc:0 "After our effective work, the food crisis of Dragonspine has been resolved! In this crisis, Miss Sucrose did not mess up everything due to a lack of experience, as predicted by those who were against the trend. From civil servants to street refugees, everyone can see Miss Sucrose running around for the people in danger. She proved her abilities to the people, and our government also declared to the entire Mondstadt that we can manage our own affairs well, and our people can live a better life."
 DRA_Sucrose_Prop:0 "Miss Sucrose Joins the Promotion"
 DRA_Sucrose_Prop_desc:0 "It will take a long time for people to accept the ugly biological alchemy products, but some actions can quickly promote the progress of such acceptance, such as letting a popular Waifu who has handled a major crisis endorse these products"
 DRA_Sucrose_Good:0 "Miss Sucrose in radiance"
 DRA_Sucrose_Good_desc:0 "After dealing with the food crisis in Dragonspine, the government staff can finally breathe a sigh of relief! This also includes Miss Sucrose, who is extremely busy. In order to avoid her hair loss and becoming bald Waifu, we need to force her to take a holiday, let her take a good rest - and then go on to the next work."
 DRA_Sucrose_Strong:0 "Miss Sucrose in good health"
 DRA_Sucrose_Strong_desc:0 "In the previous actions, Miss Sucrose took on more and more responsibilities and proved to us that she could shoulder them. However, the heavy responsibility slowly overwhelmed her body, and her tragic physical fitness became a bottleneck for the acceleration of the operation of the entire Dragonspine. Next, we will arrange a Waifu fitness coach for Miss Sucrose to improve her physical fitness through exercise, so as to better serve the people. But don't overdo it. It seems that being an Waifu with dog ears and abdominal muscles is also very...cool."
 DRA_Sucrose_Forts:0 "Sucrose Forts"
 DRA_Sucrose_Forts_desc:0 "We have decided to remain neutral in the civil war, but our enemies may not necessarily control our neutrality. In order to prevent them from launching an attack and driving straight in, we will build a series of border fortresses on the border to protect ourselves when the enemy attacks."
 DRA_Support_Our_Compatriots:0 "Improving aid mechanisms"
 DRA_Support_Our_Compatriots_desc:0 "The medical staff we sent to the entire Mondstadt earlier have brought us a good reputation and a certain degree of benefits, and the response from the supported areas is also very good. But we should see that there are still many factors that reduce our efficiency in our aid. Although our aid was effective, it did not achieve the expected outcome of dissuading the war. Now, we need to improve such mechanisms so that our compatriots can receive more timely treatment in the civil war."
 DRA_Better_our_Performance:0 "Improve our external image"
 DRA_Better_our_Performance_desc:0 "Our neutrality during the Mondstadt Civil War relied on our good external image and our strong defense capabilities based on snowcapped mountains. Now let's improve the former - which can also make other forces more willing to accept our assistance, help us heal our fellow countrymen, and expand our influence."
 DRA_Expand_our_Influences:0 "Diffuse our External impact"
 DRA_Expand_our_Influences_desc:0 "We should not only focus on the wounded and sick, but also see the root cause of the large number of these people who lack treatment - this civil war itself. If the war itself does not end, our rescue will only save these people for a while: they will still be killed and starved to death in the future. \n But we are currently unable to directly end this war with force. What we can do is to use volunteers who have already been placed in other forces to actively spread anti war ideas and influence the opinions of the people. The initial effect was weak, but over time, these small efforts will converge into an unstoppable torrent."
 DRA_More_Support:0 "Increase aid personnel"
 DRA_More_Support_desc:0 "After completing the aid reform, another group of outstanding medical talents are ready to depart for various parts of Mondstadt. Let's spend some time communicating well with local forces, so that these passionate volunteers can be properly placed."
 DRA_Allow_Speical_Action:0 "Sign a special action permit"
 DRA_Allow_Speical_Action_desc:0 "Is it acceptable to engage in minor wrongdoing for the achievement of great goals? \n Can evil deeds be modified by good intentions and become true acts of kindness? \n When she picked up the pen, Sucrose already had the answer in her heart."
 DRA_Urgent_Defense:0 "Emergency defense measures"
 DRA_Urgent_Defense_desc:0 "After the start of the Mondstadt Civil War, Mr. Albedo left behind a complete emergency mobilization plan for the face of foreign invasion before he left, hoping that it would never be used."
 DRA_For_Peoples_Live:0 "For the lives of people"
 DRA_For_Peoples_Live_desc:0 "If the food issue is a big hand that chokes our throats, then the military issue is a sharp knife behind us. After we declared neutrality, our army, the \"Albedo Chivalry\", was as depressed as if its backbone had been pulled out - they had lost their battle target. They originally regarded themselves as the defenders of Mondstadt, but now they cannot protect the remaining Mondstadt's people because they must protect the residents of Dragonspine, even if they have their relatives and friends among them. \n This situation must be reversed, and we will take measures."
 DRA_Radical_Military_Innovation:0 "Radical Military Innovation"
 DRA_Radical_Military_Innovation_desc:0 "The problem with the military now is low morale, and the root cause of this low morale is that they have lost the significance of continuing to work as soldiers. With Albedo's suggestion, Sucrose decided to promote a large number of new products made from biological alchemy in the military, and \"conveniently\" carried out reforms such as soldier committees and military democracy, supplemented by necessary ideological guidance, in an attempt to revive the morale of the military."
 DRA_CockMon_Go:0 "High-armored Cockroach Attack"
 DRA_CockMon_Go_desc:0 "Our previous reforms have been widely welcomed by half of the military, although there is also fierce opposition from the other half, which undoubtedly demonstrates the correctness of our reforms. Now, in order to expand the achievements of our reform, we will recruit a group of young people who can accept new equipment and systems into the military. They will ride the cockroaches controlled by a migical fungee and show those antique officers what advanced troops are called."
 DRA_Normal_Reorganize:0 "Encourage the fighting spirit"
 DRA_Normal_Reorganize_desc:0 "Under the advice of others, Sucrose decided to adopt common measures to boost the morale of the soldiers - such as using material incentives, giving lectures, and so on. We must make them understand that they have a responsibility to bear."
 DRA_Restore_Armies_Morale:0 "Expand the recruitment of combat personnel"
 DRA_Restore_Armies_Morale_desc:0 "The existing Dragonspine Army may be enough to rescue the snow mountain victims, but it is not enough to protect our safety. We will carry out conscription activities to allow young people who have not been affected by the gloomy atmosphere to enter the military. They can protect the residents of the snow mountain after being fully trained, and maybe they can also inspire the Albedo Chivalry like catfish."
 DRA_Take_our_Arms:0 "Pick up the weapons"
 DRA_Take_our_Arms_desc:0 "The expression once again appeared on the faces of the soldiers, who picked up their weapons again and stood on the border of the snowy mountains, waiting for a possible invasion. They will never forget that they are the soldiers - the protectors of the people of Dragonspine"
 DRA_Look_out_Dragonspine:0 "Scanning Beyond the Snowy Mountains"
 DRA_Look_out_Dragonspine_desc:0 "As we focus on dealing with snowy mountain affairs, the situation outside the Dragonspine has changed - and our situation has also changed. Let's collect information from the outside world and evaluate whether there is a need to change our course of action."
 DRA_Sucrose_Nice:0 "Miss Sucrose has a great spirit"
 DRA_Sucrose_Nice_desc:0 "The resolution of the morale issue in the military has finally put Miss Sucrose at ease for the safety of the people! Now, it's time to give her a leave - although periorbital dark circles are also a kind of cute spot and can also be used to promote our diligence, it's not good to be too tired to interfere with the work."
 DRA_Sucrose_Cash:0 "Miss Sugar is requesting funds"
 DRA_Sucrose_Cash_desc:0 "Miss Sucrose's efforts, as well as her achievements, are all evident to us. Through her attempts during these days, her innovation can be described as a great success. Now, she is asking us for more research funding - how can we disagree?"
 DRA_Promote_our_Army:0 "Promote military construction"

 DRA_Living_Signal_Receiver:0 "Living communicator"
 DRA_Living_Signal_Receiver_desc:0 "In the past, the military often relied on cavalry, messenger flags, and other methods for information transmission, which made the formulation and implementation of plans always slower than the actual situation. Now, we will use the omnipotent biological Alchemy to develop a cheap remote communicator, and popularize this communication to the squad level, so that we can always be faster in the battle."
 DRA_Firepower_and_Firepower:0 "Firepower coverage"
 DRA_Firepower_and_Firepower_desc:0 "The human resources of Dragonspine are precious, while the prices of artillery shells and elemental power are much lower.

 DRA_Firepower_and_Firepower1_desc:0 "The human resources of Dragonspine are precious, while the prices of artillery shells and elemental power are much lower.

 DRA_Guidance_System_from_Mint:0 "Mint Guidance System"
 DRA_Guidance_System_from_Mint_desc:0 "In combat, precise artillery strikes are extremely important. If we can develop such a method that allows us to accurately predict the position of enemy artillery positions, then we can significantly dampen their lethality before they attack. This time, we will use a ubiquitous organism - mint - as our initial material. The initial version will locate the mint closest to the enemy, then calibrate and launch an attack, and later versions may be able to get rid of this mode."
 DRA_Flexible_Fight:0 "Mobile Operations"
 DRA_Flexible_Fight_desc:0 "We decided to cut off the enemy's Military supply-chain management and encircle the enemy's forces with various mobile equipment - from armored vehicles, armored cavalry, plowing machines, mechanized equipment, and even bicycles. This is undoubtedly the most cutting-edge and up-to-date mode of warfare."

 DRA_Expand_Ports_desc:0 "In the past, the trade between Dragonspine and Liyue was not developed - after all, no one would want to climb the entire snow mountain to do business. But the situation is different now. In the melee of Mondstadt, Dragonspine has maintained peace and stability due to being sidelined, which has made the Liyue people only choose to trade with us. As long as we sign a few contracts with them, we can gain huge economic benefits."
 DRA_Foreign_Trade:0 "The spring glow of melting snow"
 DRA_Foreign_Trade_desc:0 "With the progress of the civil war, more and more refugees have poured into the Dragonspine, and now our capital \"Camp City\" is no longer sufficient to accommodate the increasingly developed industry. We will establish a free trade zone in the southwest direction of Dragonspine, which borders Liyue, as well as in the southeast coastal area.

 DRA_Star_Silvers_desc:0 "In these days, Miss Sucrose's \"new inventions\" are increasing, some of which even appear scary - for example, this Slime now dissolves rock walls, eats a large amount of Starsilver ore, and automatically enriches.

We have solved all the difficulties ourselves, and our economy has even surpassed that of before the civil war. Those who mocked us for maintaining a neutral and steady stance as \"cowardly\" can no longer tolerate the light of this shining city, and they are ashamed to bow their heads. \n The people of Dragonspine have proven their diligence, and we have seized our happiness with both hands!"
 DRA_Not_Stand_Alone:0 "No longer being isolated"
 DRA_Not_Stand_Alone_desc:0 "After so long, the civil war has not yet ended, death and pain still threaten every Mondstadt, and the war has not changed - but we have changed.

 DRA_Sucrose_Mental_Help:0 "Miss Sucrose Accepts Consultation"
 DRA_Sucrose_Mental_Help_desc:0 "Miss Sucrose is a kind and simple person, but it also makes her accumulate too much psychological stress when facing the dark side of the world, which will damage her mental health - and thus reduce work efficiency! This is really unbearable. We will send a Waifu psychological counselor to provide effective psychological guidance and heal the mind of Miss Sucrose."

 DRA_Unite_for_Peace_desc:0 "We should see that in the mixed warfare of Mondstadt, there are some forces who are not interested in war - such as the Wolvendom, and Springvale. We will invite them to join our government and ensure the safety of all of us through deeper cooperation."

 DRA_NO_BUGS_desc:0 "In our society, there exists a group of people who enjoy a superhuman life but have neither created material value nor contributed much spiritual wealth. They can be described as the detestable cancer cells in the Mondstadt organism - not only eroding this great collective, but also plundering the resources of truly effective cells. Now, we will strike them with an iron fist, hand over the resources they occupy to well functioning \"organs\" and \"tissues\", and accelerate the return of the body's homeostasis."
 DRA_Multi_Level_Economy:0 "Multi-level economic structure"
 DRA_Multi_Level_Economy_desc:0 "In Teyvat, some people advocate complete Economic freedom - but this is like allowing cells in the body to grow randomly, which will only lead life to death. Some people say that the government should completely control the economy, but just like the human brain cannot control every cell, how can we have enough administrative power to control every economy? Therefore, we will establish a multi-level economic structure - the government will control the economic lifeline and direct the direction of economic development like a brain, while at the same time, everyone at the bottom can have enough freedom to choose the direction of development."
 DRA_Open_on_Mouth:0 "Canary economy"
 DRA_Open_on_Mouth_desc:0 "Without freedom for the people, the country has no vitality. In order to ensure the vitality of economic development, we will ensure the free development of the market. However, a free economy is like that canary, its active appearance is naturally beautiful, but if it is not protected or bound, it will easily die. In order to protect our fragile economy from destruction, we will use the power of the government to carefully protect and limit economic development, to avoid this canary flying too far and being prey to fierce beasts."
 DRA_Green_Villages:0 "Green Village Plan"
 DRA_Green_Villages_desc:0 "In the past, under the weak old government, land mergers were uncontrolled, rural infrastructure was dilapidated, and farmers suffered unbearably.

We call this the 'Green Village Plan'."
 DRA_Born_of_Chimera:0 "Born of Chimera"
 DRA_Born_of_Chimera_desc:0 "Scattered soldiers and wanderers cannot win wars, only a united and united army can achieve victory.

 DRA_Ambiguous_Law:0 "Ambiguous bill"
 DRA_Ambiguous_Law_desc:0 "After the previous partial liberalization of the economy, there have been voices calling for us to continue promoting market freedom policies. Next, a bill aimed at promoting Economic freedom development will be announced together with a series of related subsidies. We will tell all those who are interested in entrepreneurship that we will indeed promote free economic development at the right time and place.

 DRA_Dad_Anywhere:0 "The Father of Mondstadt is everywhere"
 DRA_Dad_Anywhere_desc:0 "The failure of the old Mondstadt rule has fully demonstrated that unlimited freedom can only bring chaos and tyranny.

 DRA_Spread_New_Technique_of_Agri_desc:0 "Farmers' thinking is very simple, as long as you are willing to give them bread, they are willing to support your leadership. But farmers are also weak and backward. They often refuse to make progress and try advanced agricultural production technologies because they cannot bear the risk of failure and prefer to use old methods that are \"familiar and reliable\". For the happiness of farmers, we will send technical personnel to promote advanced agricultural technologies, such as the use of grass element pesticides. This is for their happiness, even if it is a bit rough, it is a last resort."
 DRA_Break_the_Net:0 "Break the deep state"
 DRA_Break_the_Net_desc:0 "Have you ever heard of a person's spinal cord and liver colluding with each other? Now, this situation is happening in our country - our administrative agencies have too many connections with the various giant enterprises we support, resulting in increasingly severe corruption and unacceptable production stagnation. Now, we will sever the complex and disgusting network of interests between the two and put an end to this increasingly deadly disease."
 DRA_Dad_Show_Show_Way:0 "The Father of Mondstadt shows the way"
 DRA_Dad_Show_Show_Way_desc:0 "Human rationality is limited, and the accumulation of experience is rich. It is foolish to confront the tradition formed by long-term experience with ordinary rationality. Now, the one among us who possesses the highest level of rationality and the most extensive experience, His Excellency the Grand Consul Albedo, has mastered the highest power of the economic route. He will use the experience accumulated through his long-term survival to conduct rational analysis and guide us towards a bright future."
 DRA_Stop_Weakening:0 "Eliminate the decline of nation"
 DRA_Stop_Weakening_desc:0 "The long-term rationing system and the out of control market economy have deeply damaged Montstadtians.

 DRA_The_Iron_Order:0 "The Order of Iron Thorns"
 DRA_The_Iron_Order_desc:0 "The prolonged chaos has destroyed the grassroots government of Mondstadt. Before a normal government is established again, we will conduct military control in various regions to promote various measures in the absence of administrative personnel, while eliminating opposition elements that disrupt Mondstadt's reconstruction. A simple and rough order is better than a completely unruly chaos."
 DRA_No_another_V:0 "Goodbye Vennessa"
 DRA_No_another_V_desc:0 "In all parts of Mondstadt, there are also some despicable villains who oppose the new order of Mondstadt - such as ridiculous Monarchism, despicable supporters of the old government and detestable Great Harmony.

 DRA_Wind_of_Decarabian:0 "Wind of Decarabian"
 DRA_Wind_of_Decarabian_desc:0 "We will carry out promotional activities to reinterpret the history of the \"Decarabian\" from various perspectives, and seek legitimacy for the establishment of our new order. The purpose of this operation is mainly to test the capacity of our new propaganda department, and try to find out those opponents hidden among the people - then test the capacity of our new secret police force."
 DRA_Supervise_V_owners:0 "Supervise Vision Owners"
 DRA_Supervise_V_owners_desc:0 "The owners of Vision are often considered as heroes, but they also have another identity - that is, the masters of extraordinary personal force.

 DRA_Real_Meaning_of_Wind:0 "The 'True Meaning' of Barbatos"
 DRA_Real_Meaning_of_Wind_desc:0 "The \"freedom\" teachings of the archon Barbatos are understood by many to seek unrestricted freedom, and even complete chaos. From this understanding, a absurd culture of worship for looseness and chaos has emerged. Nowadays, those radical opponents have been suppressed in previous actions, and the Church of Favonius has also been in our hands. For the sake of social order, we will reinterpret Barbatos' teachings, let the people of Mondstadt understand the importance of order, and lay the foundation for a new culture that advocates order."
 DRA_Play_the_Metal_Drum:0 "Play the metal drum"
 DRA_Play_the_Metal_Drum_desc:0 "人The education he receives determines what kind of person he becomes. In the civil war, normal educational institutions have been destroyed, but it is also convenient for us to abandon the outdated education system and establish a new education system that serves the prosperity of our own nation. We will educate children into hardworking, brave, and responsible adults, and create exquisite gears for this huge machine of the country."
 DRA_Pure_Nation:0 "A nation is born out of purity"
 DRA_Pure_Nation_desc:0 "旧The government's indulgence towards foreigners was one of the important causes of the civil war. Such policies allowed the Liyue people to steal our wealth, the Sumeru people to steal our knowledge, and even the Snezhnaya people to take advantage of the situation and incite the Mondstasdtian people to engage in cannibalism. We will not let this happen again. \n After a long period of reconstruction, we have sufficient strength to control the border. From now on, foreigners will not be allowed to enter and exit Mondstadt at will, and the Mondstadt nation will regain its purity."
 DRA_Great_Dictator:0 "Leaders are great due to dictatorship"
 DRA_Great_Dictator_desc:0 "Humanity becomes stronger in eternal struggle, and the longer the struggle, the stronger it becomes. Among us, there is a character who not only fought for a long time in the past, but also will continue to fight for the future of the Mondstadt nation in the future.

We will follow his footsteps until death."
 DRA_Nation_Strengthened_For_Dictatorship:0 "The country is strong due to dictatorship"
 DRA_Nation_Strengthened_For_Dictatorship_desc:0 "The creation of a great country is not something that a loose and weak nationalist coalition can do.

We will use the name of evil as the foundation for the good deeds of the Mondstadt nation, and lay the foundation for authoritarianism for the glory of the nation."

 dragonspine.1.d:0 "\"Today, the cold Dragonspine rarely receives a warm ray of sunshine, neither scorching nor dark, only making people feel refreshed. Under the sunshine, there are the newly built International Research Institute and scholars from around the world celebrating its completion. Everyone is smiling, especially the Mondstadt's people - every Mondstadtian who comes here is amazed by the beauty and connotation of the design of the International Research Institute In terms of knowledge, they regard this college as a symbol of Mondstadt's prosperity, like the small flag that explorers put on top of a mountain after climbing.\n\nAt first, this institute was intended to be established in Mondstadt City, but later, with the implementation of the development plan of Dragonspine, the Knights of Favonius realized that the large number of historic sites in Dragonspine was very suitable for the needs of a research institute, and the construction of this institute in Dragonspine would also make the development plan of Dragonspine more smoothly, so they assigned this task to the second phase development plan of Dragonspine——\n\n——§C Chief Alchemy §B Albedo §!, Let him be the leader of the plan to turn the uninhabited land of Dragonspine into a paradise for the Mondstadtians.\n\nIn this busy time, the Knights also sent the §H librarian §b Lisa §! Assist him in his work. After reducing her work, Lisa will return to Mondstadt City to continue her happy library management time of drinking tea and fishing.\n\nAmong a large number of scholars, one girl deserves special attention. She is the Alchemy of §B Bioalchemy School §R named sSucrose §!. The girl has been entrusted by the Order of chivalry to develop creatures that can survive in the harsh environment of snow mountains. Her research has come to an end, and she will return to Mondstadt City in a while to continue investing in her own research area.\n\nEveryone here has beautiful expectations for the future, but that future may not come.\n\n§R Mondstadt is about to be shattered, and the fate of Dragonspine is about to unfold!.§!"
 dragonspine.1.a:0 "This world is just a sad stage."
 dragonspine.1.b:0 "All heroes dance wildly under the command of fate."
 dragonspine.2.t:0 "Sucrose's Work"
 dragonspine.2.d:0 "\"What a masterpiece! \" Exclaimed a female scholar from Sumeru.\" A masterpiece that balances utility and demand! Such a species should be named by its creator. Miss Sucrose, what should she be called.\"\n\n\"Hmm... \"Sucrose stared at the plant in front of her and pondered for a long time.\n\n\"It sounds very poetic! What kind of idea is it\"\n\nSucrose directly expressed its thoughts and said, \"Because this is a flower that can grow on snow, it is called Snow Flower\"\n\n\"...Did you use to name it that way?\"\n\n\"Yes! I used to have several inventions called \"Flowers plants\", \"Grass flowers\", and \"Grass flowers\"!\"\n\nNow it's the turn of the female scholar to choke in silence. Seeing her expression, Sucrose couldn't help but ask:\n\n\"Uh, no, can't we?\"\n\n——Who can say 'no' to this pitiful young girl when they see her? Today's female scholar recalled this day with such reflections. But besides this feeling, she also has one regret:"
 dragonspine.2.a:0 "I really want to touch her ears."
 dragonspine.3.t:0 "The Invention of Sucrose"
 dragonspine.3.d:0 "The news of a bountiful harvest in the experimental field quickly spread throughout the entire Dragonspine. Many people gathered to observe the golden patch in the experimental field and exclaimed in amazement.\n\nMany of them have been living here for many years and have long been accustomed to the snowy mountains, which grow nothing but mint and coniferous wood. But at this moment, seeing the rolling wheat waves, a love for life surged again from their hearts.\n\nA respondent said, 'Actually, when I first heard about cold resistant crops, I didn't believe it.'. I think unless we are going to grow peppermint and sweet flowers in the snowy mountains, what other crops can we grow here? Even people cannot live here. But I didn't expect it to succeed! '\n\nThe golden wheat that sprouted in the white snow grew in places where it should not have existed - just like today's Dragonspine where people built beautiful and prosperous towns. This wheat is not only a guarantee of our food, but also a symbol of the courage and pioneering spirit of the people of Dragonspine\n\n——Four months ago, the Dragonspine La Vanguardia"
 dragonspine.3.a:0 "Can we give a more poetic name?"
 dragonspine.3.b:0 "Immediately carry out large-scale promotion!"
 dragonspine.4.t:0 "Albedo's Work"
 dragonspine.4.d:0 "\"The theme of today's meeting is to implement Mondstadt's Labor Law, focus on cracking down on illegal and forced overtime work by factory owners, and ensure that workers have the right to work no more than fourteen hours a day and no more than eighty-four hours a week in total\"\n\nThe Dragonspine congress, led by Albedo, is known as the \"zoo\". However, when Albedo stood up to speak, even the zoo remained silent, with only the rustling of paper money.\n\n——This is not to say that Albedo is some kind of dictator or terrifying political powerhouse, he is just too impeccable. When anyone attempts to confront their viewpoint, they will be refuted with detailed, effective, and truthful information, and ultimately end up with nothing but embarrassment and humiliation. At the beginning, many people would question Albedo's decision; Later, only some young fools would argue with Albedo; By now, everyone has been trained to have conditioned reflexes like Pavlov's dogs.\n\nOf course, this does not mean that Albedo is disliked. Everyone knows that Mr. Albedo is a kind person, but he is worried about being too distracted by interpersonal relationships in order to maintain an appropriate distance from most people.\n\nThere are also many people in this parliament who look at Albedo with admiration. In their view, this outstanding figure, despite possessing the ability to monopolize power, still adheres to democratic procedures, which is simply the embodiment of democratic spirit.\n\nHowever, Albedo himself does not care about power. In his opinion, his most fundamental identity is Alchemy master."
 dragonspine.4.a:0 "Since Mr. Albedo says that, then there's no problem."
 dragonspine.5.t:0 "Albedo's Achievements"
 dragonspine.5.d:0 "Albedo finally signed his name on the document.\n\nThree months before the completion of the International Research Institute, all the predetermined goals of the Dragonspine Phase II development plan were finally achieved. This plan was originally aimed at developing star silver resources in the snowcapped mountains, allowing Mondstadt to obtain a monopoly product in the world trade of Teyvat to generate significant trade revenue. With the progress of the plan, people have discovered that there are still a large number of available resources idle in  Dragonspine, which are not developed by anyone. In order to utilize these resources, the second phase development plan of  Dragonspine has begun: the cold and fresh meat in  Dragonspine has been fried as a luxury item for hundreds of thousands of moles, bringing rich income to residents; The campsite and snow covered road at the foot of the snowy mountain have undergone significant changes, with alchemy devices that utilize the element of fire providing light and heat everywhere; More and more residents are migrating here in search of a better life\n\nIn the scheduled third phase development plan, we will also build various ice and snow sports facilities and explore and sightseeing projects on  Dragonspine, and develop every penny of the value of this huge treasure trove of Dragonspine."
 dragonspine.5.a:0 "Advance work at a normal pace."
 dragonspine.5.b:0 "Push forward with one go!"
 dragonspine.6.t:0 "Lisa's Work"
 dragonspine.6.d:0 "\"Even when she arrived at Dragonspine, Aunt... Ms. Lisa still looked carefree. Since the day she arrived, the whole office has always been filled with the fragrance of tea. When she went out to work one day, some people in the office were wondering how the tea fragrance had dissipated. Watching her like this always made people think, 'Is this work attitude really okay?'\n\nBut if you ask Ms. Lisa about her work status, she will always show you the work results she has completed just right.\n\nA few days after she arrived, even those who had never met Ms. Lisa fell in love with this beautiful and knowledgeable librarian. If there is anything you want to consult, she can always provide us with an answer. If encountering special difficulties, she will also give us the potion she has made herself to overcome... However, be careful not to disturb her during her recovery time and afternoon tea time.\n\nIf only I could be as beautiful and intelligent as Ms. Lisa, then perhaps someone would like me?\""
 dragonspine.6.a:0 "——From Dragonspine, a female civil servant's evaluation of Lisa."
 dragonspine.7.t:0 "Lisa's Rescue"
 dragonspine.7.d:0 "——Cold. Joseph no longer felt the cold.\n\nThe food has been eaten up, the fuel has been used up, and even with all his strength, it is impossible to reach any known supply point... Although he is still alive, Joseph has understood that he is just a thinking corpse. As long as it goes on for a while, even this thought cannot be sustained. At that time, he will die, silently dying in a corner of this world, and no one will think of him again.\n\nNo, there will still be someone who misses him, Joseph remembered, that's his child. How is that child now? Will he still be in the camp at the foot of the mountain, asking passersby about his father's whereabouts?\n\nI'm really not a competent father, he thought.\n\n——At this moment, he heard the sound of electricity. He initially thought it was his ears that had finally frozen out, but when the sound changed, he was worried that it was his own brain that had the problem: perhaps he had finally seen an illusion.\n\n\"This is the search and rescue team from Dragonpsine \"said the elegant and leisurely female voice.\" We have determined your approximate location, but we still need you to cooperate with the rescue. As long as you do as I say, you can ensure the safety of your name\"\n\nA glimmer of hope ignited in Joseph's heart, as if a force had emerged from nowhere in his body.\n\n\nOne hour later, under the guidance of Ms. Lisa, Mr. Joseph was successfully rescued and reunited with his son Joel. This happened three months ago."
 dragonspine.7.a:0 "Good Job!"
 dragonspine.7.b:0 "Popularize such rescue measures immediately!"
 dragonspine.8.t:0 "Internal turmoil in the management organization!"
 dragonspine.8.d:0 "Our local government knew the news of disintegration of the Mondstadt earlier than anyone else, and the clever administrative personnel in the government immediately guessed what might happen. Many people do not believe that we can maintain order in the snowy mountains and have started to pack up their burdens; Some people believe that the work they are currently working on has lost its meaning and decide to slow down in place before new orders are issued; The work efficiency of those who truly want to continue administrative work and maintain order in the snowcapped mountains has significantly decreased due to the first two types of people. More importantly, many of our personnel have been sent out due to previous plans, and the current government order is also difficult to maintain. This chaos is likely to continue for some time.\n\n What is even more terrifying than this chaos is that our government can't do anything about it, and the subsequent events it triggers..."
 dragonspine.8.a:0 "ORDER!!!"
 dragonspine.8.b:0 "How could the government be like this!"
 dragonspine.9.t:0 "Material supply is cutting off!"
 dragonspine.9.d:0 "New news has arrived. Because our government is semi paralyzed, the news was first discovered by the local people - the supply of goods from the Knights of Favonius has stopped, because the warlords blocked the delivery route of goods because of the beginning of the civil war. Other materials are fine, and after long-term development, we have been able to independently produce most of the necessary goods... However, our local agriculture is not enough to meet our food needs.\n\nFortunately, we have foresight: Mr. Albedo began to reserve Strategic material three months ago when the second phase of the development plan was completed. After three months, we may have filled the granary."
 dragonspine.9.a:0 "Madam, you just ate the last Sweet Madame."
 dragonspine.9.b:0 "I can't even think about it anymore... There's no Teyvat Fried Egg left?"
 dragonspine.10.t:0 "Foreign scholars conspire!"
 dragonspine.10.d:0 "The news of the internal turmoil in Mondstadt has spread to six other countries. If the Liyue people may just want to make our war profits and resell something to us, then the Sumeru people can be said to be malicious. After restoring order to our police agency, we have come across new news. The university officials at the Akademiya have ordered Sumeru scholars in Dragonspine to find ways to gain access to Mondstadt's secret knowledge and even intervene in our politics"
 dragonspine.10.a:0 "These overseas forces who take advantage of the fire and loot!"
 dragonspine.10.b:0 "This must be a conspiracy of the Grand Sage!"
 dragonspine.11.t:0 "The army is in chaos!"
 dragonspine.11.d:0 "Our confidentiality measures are unlikely to be effective in the current situation, and news of the internal turmoil in Mondstadt immediately spread throughout the entire Dragonspine region, having a negative impact on the local army.\n\nThis army was originally a local guard sent by the Knights of Favonius to the Dragonspine region, which was also responsible for the rescue of victims in the snow mountain and the exploration of dangerous areas. Now there has been a split in the army: some people want to lead troops back to defend Mondstadt City, others agree with the idea of the separatist forces, others recognize the possible chaos, and simply act as deserters.\n\nThis chaos should end after a period of time, but the morale that has been hit cannot quickly recover."
 dragonspine.11.a:0 "Do we still have manpower to reorganize the troops?"
 dragonspine.11.b:0 "Land battle will unable to deploy."
 dragonspine.12.t:0 "Workers stop working!"
 dragonspine.12.d:0 "Our confidentiality measures are unlikely to be effective in the current situation, and news of the internal turmoil in Mondstadt immediately spread throughout the entire Dragonspine region. Upon learning of this news, local residents immediately sparked a wave of public opinion. The worry about the future fills everyone's heart, and many constructions and production work has stopped - because they are no longer useful in the foreseeable future. The gloomy atmosphere gradually permeated the entire Dragonspine."
 dragonspine.12.a:0 "It seems that they cannot be blamed."
 dragonspine.12.b:0 "What should we do?"
 dragonspine.13.t:0 "Albedo elected"
 dragonspine.13.d:0 "Albedo stopped speaking without any hesitation, while the people below applauded vigorously. In normal times, such an attitude may be considered overly cold; Now, this coldness is considered a sign of confidence and calm rationality.\n\nHe himself gazed at the audience and thought to himself, 'These people may just need a spiritual support to make them feel that the difficulties are about to pass and a stable life is about to return.'. But he wouldn't think there was anything wrong with it... On the contrary, he was about to respond to the wishes of these people.\n\n\"Everyone, we still have a lot to do, \"he said.\" Let's get back to our position.\""
 dragonspine.13.a:0 "Albedo will bring back peace and stability!"
 dragonspine.14.t:0 "Lisa elected"
 dragonspine.14.d:0 "When Lisa walked onto the stage, many people believed that she would make some inconspicuous remarks; But she showed a calm side that people usually don't see:\n\n\"If there is a war, we must win.

 dragonspine.49.d:0 "It is reported that recently, under the excellent command of General Albedo, the army led by Dragonspine successfully captured Dawn Winery, bringing an important victory to the Snow Mountain Territory.\n\nAccording to military sources, Lord Albedo led the army through remote communication in Snow Mountain, and after three months of arduous combat, finally captured the Dawn Winery located on the edge. It is understood that Dawn Winery has always been an important stronghold for the enemy, with not only a solid defense system, but also a large number of military guards. But under Albedo's precise remote command, the army led by Dragonspine successfully weakened the enemy's defenses and ultimately captured the winery.\n\nThe achievement of this victory not only signifies the full display of the strength and combat effectiveness of the Snow Mountain Leading Army, but more importantly, it brings new development opportunities to the Dragonspine Territory. It is reported that Dawn Winery is a unique place with rich natural resources and industrial foundation. Capturing the area will bring new economic prosperity and military strategic advantages to Snow Mountain.\n\nThe victory this time cannot be achieved without the precise command of Speaker Albedo and the brave combat of the army, as well as the support and cooperation of all parties led by Dragonspine. We believe that under the leadership of General Albedo and commanders at all levels, Dragonspine will continue to fight and strive for the honor, dignity, and interests of the country and people!"

However, what was even more surprising was that the good military discipline of this army also deeply moved the residents.\n\nIt is reported that as soon as the sugar army arrived at the winery, they began organizing battles and defeated the stationed troops outside the winery after several days of siege. But later on, they did not wreak havoc like the general army did, but instead began a detailed search of the winery.\n\nDuring the search, they maintained good interaction and communication with the employees and residents of the winery, without showing any threat or harm. Even more rare is that they also proactively provided necessary food and medical assistance to the residents of the winery.\n\nMany residents expressed their emotions towards the performance of the Dragonspine Army. They said that in the past, they had heard from aid workers that the Dragonspine army was very friendly, but they never believed - in the Mondstadt Civil War, who could trust the military discipline of the troops? But from this operation, they truly felt the humanity and goodwill of this army. Many residents even exclaimed, \"So the military can also be so friendly.\"\n\nFor the Dragonspine Army, the success of this operation is not only good news, but also a manifestation of their consistent advocacy of peace, democracy, and cooperation. We believe that the Sucrose Army will continue to uphold such military discipline and become a widely respected and trusted army in future operations."

Perhaps it is these issues that have weakened their strength and made them choose to stay away from the disputes of the civil war.\n\nUnlike many Mondstadtian thought, Dragonspine has become an economically prosperous and populous region after two development plans.
