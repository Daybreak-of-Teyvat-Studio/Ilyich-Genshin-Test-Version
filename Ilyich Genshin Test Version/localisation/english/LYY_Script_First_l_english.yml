 LYY_food_and_goods_desc:0"Hong Fan has eight policies, one is food, the other is goods. Food refers to the food that can be eaten by farmers in Jiagu, and goods refer to cloth, silk, clothing, gold, knives and tortoise shells, so it is also necessary to divide the wealth. Both, the foundation of the people, flourished from the world of the rock king. The wood is for the wood, and the wood is for the thunder. The benefit of the thunder is to teach the world and eat enough. Japan and China are the market, to the people of the world, to gather goods from all over the world, and to retreat after trading, each in its place, and the goods pass. "We should be well-fed and well-supplied, and then the country will be solid and the people will be rich, and we will be educated."

General Zhongyun announced that he would March on Yujingtai and make himself a military dictator of Liyue. In this regard, Tianquan Ningguang tried to organize a new government including Feiyun Chamber of Commerce, Heiyan Factory, Southern Cross Fleet and other forces to alleviate the crisis. In the face of the threat of General Zhong Yun, the engineers' representative committee of Liyuegang and the farmers' association of Qingce Village chose to compromise. In the end, a temporary five-member ruling cabinet was established in Liyuegang, consisting of four former Seven Stars and a representative of the people of Liyuegang, headed by Tianquan Ningguang, who temporarily exercised political power until the problem was solved.

On the other hand, when Quan Ningguang publicly denied that the government had any such intention, he was laughed scornfully by the people. "The Voice of the People in Liyue" shouted loudly: "Forced by the pressure of the revolution, the interim government lied in order to get out, ensuring that it never thought of fleeing from Liyue Port, and said that it was unwilling to give up Bishuiyuan. 」"

"Belongs to the interim government? \n "The provisional government is finished," one of the guards replied with a smile, "Thank God! This is all I can get from him. \nPedestrians are walking on Chihuyan Street as usual, shops are open as usual, and the crowds in the street don't seem to be as uneasy as they were yesterday.

The General Assembly announced the establishment of the Seven Stars Revolutionary Committee, and the interim government has been overthrown. The revolutionary committee regime will immediately propose a democratic peace treaty to the people of all countries, strive to achieve peace, ensure that the landlord's land will be handed over to the farmers' committee for free, completely democratize the army, and establish a system for workers to supervise production ... \n The Congress decided that all political power in all localities will be transferred to the regional revolutionary committees, and the local revolutionary committees should be responsible for ensuring the real revolutionary order. The new government will take all measures to stabilize the situation, achieve peace and establish democracy. \n At the same time, Tianquan Ningguang, Xianlin Ganyu, Chongyun and Shenhe, the immortal minions, attempted to transfer troops to Liyue Port to overthrow the new revolutionary regime. Soldiers, workers, employees, actively resist the three-eyed and five-faced immortals and cruel capital businessmen! Be vigilant!

Xiangling arrived after the appointed time. \n "I'm sorry, I'm just preparing for the exam for the official department of Yujingtai." \n "What is the official department of Yujingtai? Xin Yan's son asked. " \n "What is an exam? "Asked the autumn. "
 LYY.7.a:0"What is an exam?"
 LYY.8.t: "Food is the most important thing for people."
 LYY.8.d: "When the commercial road was reopened, the soaring food prices in Liyue Port finally began to fall, and the consequences of soaring food prices have only now become apparent-if you don't eat, the government will not be able to operate, the population will not grow (generally, it will only go backwards), and even the army will lose its combat effectiveness (provided that they will not mutiny). Take a quick look at this chaos in Liyue Port! If we don't solve the famine, it will be solved by the people! "
 LYY.9.a: "Happiness never comes in pairs, but it never rains but it pours ..."
 LYY.10.t: "Self-condemnation"
 LYY.10.d: "A Qianyan Army hanged himself in the barracks. Mr. Atractylodes macrocephala, who was not aware of it, judged that the time of death was about ten o'clock in the morning. At this time, it was the time of daily practice, not to mention the dereliction of duty of the instructor for the time being. There was a suicide note on the desk, which read as follows:" When I joined Qianyan Army on the first day, I firmly believed in guarding the beautiful mountains and rivers and lights, but all these beliefs collapsed. They will all starve to death! It shouldn't be like this, nothing should be like this! We are the Thousand Rock Army, not the treasure thieves! Even the thieves can't do such a thing! Looking at the stolen military expenses and eating the stolen military pay, I have thought twice. I think, I am afraid I can't live with a clear conscience anymore ... "
 LYY.10.a: "We are the ones who should commit suicide ..."
 LYY.12.t: "belated implementation"
 LYY.12.d: "Jinlong stood in front of Zhi En, a thousand rock troops who came to search, shaking like chaff, and his legs trembled. It was Zhien who spoke first: "Jinlong, right?" This sentence was like a thunder in Jinlong's heart, and he couldn't stand it. He plopped down on his knees and said, "Master Jun, forgive me! Master Jun, spare my life! I know it's wrong! I dare not do that again! I ..... I ... I'll open the warehouse and put the grain! I give out all my food! Spare my life, Sir! " Zhien looked at him in disgust and posted a list on his face: "This is your illegal income from sitting on the ground during the great famine, totaling 68 million 420 molars. Look at the account, right?" Is there anything else to say? " Jinlong is still kneeling: "No ... Yes ... I ...!" Before he could finish, Zhien waved and had him taken down, dragging a water mark all the way-he was scared to pee. The next day, amid ghost cries and cheers one after another, Jinlong and 38 other profiteers who were hoarding were hanged and hung high at Liyue gate. "
 LYY.12.a: "I should have died a long time ago!"
 LYY.13.t: "The Harbor of Rock and Contract"
 LYY.13.d: "This is Liyue, the most prosperous port in Tivat, which has been developed by leaps and bounds under the protection of Emperor Jun of the Rock for thousands of years. It has a very mature maritime trade route, and Mora from all over the mainland keeps pouring here. As the territory of the rock god, it is rich in mineral resources. "The Moon Mountain is winding and undulating, and there are many places to build a good pass."
 LYY.13.a: "A thousand rocks are firm, but they can't be moved!"
 LYY.14.t: "Strange sense of disobedience"
 LYY.14.d: "Ke Qing doesn't know how many times she has been called by Ning Guang. Even though she has a prejudice against Ning Guang's style, she doesn't have any dissatisfaction. After all, this is in preparation for" inviting immortals ",and there is no room for any slack. When I entered the Jade Pavilion, the first thing I saw was a group of busy secretaries. Carving Qing didn't care about these things and ran directly to the condensed light standing in front of the wall full of documents: "Condensed light? What can I do for you? " \n Ning Guang turned around and pointed to the plush chair next to him: "Well, you're here. Sit down." \n "It's unnecessary to be polite. What's the job?" \n "Sure enough, it's still carved by Yuheng Star. It's really direct. Regarding the security problem of' Please ask the Immortal Rite' ..." \n "There's no need to worry about this, it's already well prepared." \n "Well, I always have a kind of ... Oh, that's all." \n Staring out of the window, I didn't say anything. "
 LYY.14.a: "The calm before the storm?"
 LYY.15.t: "The Fall of the Rock God"
 LYY.15.d: "From all kinds of news flowing out of the contract city, I am afraid that the oldest rock god has really fallen. Qianyan Army has blocked every road where Liyue left the country and banned all trade. No one can go in and out from Liyue at will. Undoubtedly, Tiwat's economy will be greatly affected, and all this will probably last until the investigation into the assassination of the rock god in Liyue comes out."
 LYY.15.a: "When is Barbatos's turn?"
 LYY.16.t: "Disaster"
 LYY.16.d: "Kering frowned and hurried, and no one dared to ask what had happened, but everyone knew that Emperor Yan died on the celestial ritual instrument invited by the previous Tianquan Star Condensing Light Organization. I'm afraid this is the only thing that made Yu Heng so nervous. \n "§C ondensed light!" Carved fine rushed into the jade pavilion and found that six other people besides themselves had been waiting here for a long time-in other words, they didn't leave a step since the assassination of the emperor. \n Everyone's face is haggard. It seems that they are so busy these days that even the condensation light is not as calm as usual, and their eyes reveal a little fatigue. \n "Ke Qing, you're here. What's the news from Qianyan Army?" \n "No progress." \n "We must find a new way!" \n "If this continues, Liyue will collapse!" \n After listening to the report of carved sunny, the following finally broke out. \n Ning Guang shook his head, pondered for a while, and said, "
 LYY.16.a: "Qianyan Army will be fully responsible for the investigation of the news of the Immortal blockade!"

 LYY_Depression_News.1.d:0"The death of Emperor Jun, the King of Rock, has had a great impact on Liyue's economy. As the biggest financial pillar of Liyue, the existence of Emperor Yanwang ensured the stability and credit of Liyue Mora. His death made all the people in Tivat doubt the value of Moon Mora, which led to an unprecedented Mora panic. Many Liyue people are worried that the value of Mora will fall, and they flock to banks to exchange other stable assets, and a run frenzy appears in every Liyue bank. There are long queues in banks all over Liyue, and some banks even suspend business because of lack of cash. This kind of run-off frenzy has brought heavy pressure to Liyue's financial system, and even the authoritative organization such as Liyue Central Gold House is hard to cope with. Liyue's government and chamber of commerce are urgently formulating countermeasures to try to restore people's confidence in Mora, but the effect is not obvious yet. Liyue is facing an unprecedented economic crisis. With the currency crisis came the crash of Liyue stock market. Liyue's share price plummeted on the day of yesterday's month-by-month festival, and even the share price of Southern Cross Fleet Company, which monopolized Liyue's overseas transportation trade, was cut short!

Due to the continuous deterioration of Liyue's economy, a terrible chain reaction soon occurred: crazy run, bank closure, stock market evaporation, bubble burst, factory closure, workers unemployment, Liyue constantly fell into the abyss. These incidents caused panic and anger among the people, which led to social unrest and violent conflicts. The temporary government of Liyue tried to save the situation through austerity policies and diplomatic efforts, but the effect was very little. Some opposition parties and civil organizations began to organize protests and demonstrations, demanding that the government step down. Li Yue's allies and enemies are watching, waiting for the best opportunity to intervene or take advantage of this precarious country. Many people began to flee Liyue and seek refuge elsewhere.

They wandered around the country, sometimes sleeping in jungles, parks, streets, railway stations, and sometimes living in dilapidated houses made of wooden boards, old iron sheets, tarpaulins and even kraft paper, relying on little relief to survive. In the busy streets of the past, shanty towns built of old iron sheets, cardboard and burlap appeared, which was quite different from the prosperity declared by Chairman Ning Guang when he took office, so people called it Ning Guang Village. At the same time, in order to eliminate the so-called surplus supply and raise the price of products, the profit-oriented capitalists began to destroy a large number of surplus products. Master Xing Qiu of Feiyun Chamber of Commerce ordered his subordinates to pour thousands of tons of coconut milk into Liyue Port, making Liyue Port a silver port. These heinous acts aroused people's anger and dissatisfaction. They began to organize themselves to make demands and protests to the government and capitalists. They demand that the government provide more employment opportunities and social security, and that capitalists stop wasting and exploiting. They also demanded that Chairman Ning Guang step down, because she did not fulfill her promise, but colluded with capitalists and sacrificed the interests of the people. They chanted "Step Down with Light", "Feiyun Chamber of Commerce will roll out of the glass moon", "People want to survive" and "People want dignity". -reported by Liyuegang Workers Daily "

Other economists believe that raising tariffs is a necessary means to deal with the economic crisis, which can protect domestic industries, increase fiscal revenue and promote the development of the domestic market. The temporary government of Liyue said that the tariff increase was carried out under the premise of complying with the rules of the World Trade Organization, aiming at safeguarding Liyue's national interests and economic security. At the same time, the interim government of Liyue also expressed its willingness to conduct friendly consultations with other countries and seek solutions to jointly cope with the economic crisis. -the latest market research report of Mondelet Genfende Wine Industry "

 KQP_the_people_revolutionary_committee_idea_desc: "The People's Revolutionary Committee is a new administrative system headed by Ke Qing, which abolished the national meritocracy of" rule by man "under the past seven-star system and replaced it with an electoral system. Theoretically, all citizens have the right to vote, but in fact, the election is still mainly determined by the local control of the Committee, the support of the people and the popularity of ethnic groups. But on the whole, the People's Committee is still representative of the public, although its operation is seriously torn by this "excessive" democracy. "
 KQP_thin_dominance_idea: "The dominance is thin"
 KQP_thin_domination_idea_desc: "Although the People's Revolutionary Committee has occupied the most affluent and easily supported by the old mainland, our control over other areas is obviously not optimistic. Treasure thieves, new American terrorists, and even slime Chuqiu people have all threatened our rule. In the past, radical urbanization made our relationship with farmers worse.

 LYY_harbor_of_wealth_idea_desc: "g Ships built for" circulation "will also call at ports, so Liyue is the place where all wealth is" deposited ". -Morax! \n Liyue, the commercial capital since ancient times, is a "dream factory" in the eyes of countless people. Emperor Yanwang will make wise judgments every year to guide the development of Liyue. Xiaoxiao also dared not oppress the merchants of Liyue because of the "§C ontract" of the Emperor. Even after the industrial revolution in Fengdan, Liyue still gathered wealth with its huge size and keen vision of those in power. "
 LYY_Labor_Dispatch_idea: "labor dispatch"
 LYY_labor_dispatch_idea_desc: "g We are all begging for a living. We are no longer the strong and enthusiastic children who left Oruro, but just pale figures. We just want to go home. -Herman Busch Becerra! \n When the wave of industrial revolution came from Fengdan, Liyue quickly accepted it: factories sprang up, countless families were dragged out of farmland and into the smoke, and Liyue's goods once again sold well in the world ... However, the population of Liyue alone could not satisfy the behemoth of capital. It has set its sights on foreign countries, where there are still countless laborers waiting for it to "§C onquer". As a result, groups of people set foot on this land for various reasons. They were either lost in the world of flowers or simply caught and plundered here. Among them, the largest proportion is the labor dispatch agreement signed between Liyue and Cyrus. Theoretically, the Agreement is a win-win situation. Liyue got the labor it needed, and Cyrus could get a group of workers with professional quality after the Agreement ended, and even get remittances from these workers to build the country. But what about the workers? Maybe it's just those g bones without graves! To make those stories clear! Ok ... "
 LYY_Low_Quality_Industry_idea: "low-quality industry"
 LYY_low_quality_industry_idea_desc: "It's a pity, although Liyue began to lay out at the beginning of the industrial revolution. But so far, Liyue's technology is still not comparable to Fengdan's, and it can even be said that it is difficult for Liyue to design new products independently. Long-standing tradition makes Liyue lack of technical talents. At this point, Liyue is not even as good as Mond, which leads to Fontaine's arbitrary collection of "patent tax" from Liyue, which seriously slows down the progress and speed of Liyue's industrialization. At the same time, Liyue's policy of strongly encouraging the establishment of factories in the early days led to the emergence of a large number of mixed products, which also aroused consumer dissatisfaction. "
 LYY_Crippled_Labor_Laws_idea: "Disabled Labor Law"
 LYY_Crippled_Labor_Laws_Idea_Desc: "In the early days, the Liyue government strongly encouraged investment. In order to reassure the capital, there was no "Labor Law" at all in the early days of Liyue! It was not until last year that Ke Qing, a "jade star", put forward the Labor Law for the first time, which was voted by Seven Stars, but eventually compromised. On the surface, the negotiated Labor Law follows the principles of nine-hour labor law, universal medical insurance, prohibition of child labor, etc., but in fact, no institution can accept labor disputes at all, and it is jokingly called "disabled labor law."

Facing the tragic situation of Liyue, Yu Hengxing can no longer tolerate the retrograde application of condensed light. Launched this revolutionary movement. Now, according to the advice of the winter.

After investigating the clues of the crime many times, Qianyan Army only found traces of ice force at the scene and hastily closed the case. The people of Liyue could not accept this result and asked the seven stars of Liyue to make a reply and formally mourn for the emperor. On the surprise day of the calendar, on the news note held by the seven stars of Liyue, represented by carved clear and condensed light, and the hall of death, represented by walnuts and bells. Carved fine thought Ningguang would read according to the manuscript written by Yuehai Pavilion, but things far exceeded expectations. Ning Guang said plausibly to many reporters: "According to the latest investigation of Qian Yanjun, we found the broken petals of Qing Xin at the crime scene, which is an important evidence of our assassination of Emperor Jun. I believe the results will be announced to you soon." Then, under the astonished eyes of carved shine, condensed light indicated that the press conference was over. On the same day, the price of Qing Xin plummeted. \n "What are you doing? This is completely different from saying good!

People who eat pure heart are everywhere. Don't worry, there will be a new business plan for Liyuegang in the near future, so don't come to me easily if you have anything important. Baixiao, see the guests off. " \n Moment Qing clenched her fist, but she had no choice but to leave the Jade Pavilion bitterly. Ke Qing thought that it really wouldn't implicate anyone, but she was wrong. \n Outside Bubulu Gate, Gan Yu looked at the cheap pure heart, hesitated and went in, and was about to take out Mora to buy it. Two Qianyan officers entered Bubulu and said seriously to Gan Yu: "You are suspected to be related to the assassination of the Emperor. Please come back with us to assist in the investigation." Although Gan Yu was confused, he left with others in order not to affect their medical treatment and medicine. A reporter who just entered Bubulu filmed this scene, and the headline that night [shocked, Gan Yu turned out to be the real murderer of the assassination of the Emperor! ］。 "
 LYY_New_Event.1.a:0"How can a secretary assassinate the Emperor?"
 LYY_New_Event.2.t:0"What will I do about it?"
 LYY_New_Event.2.d:0"Kering angrily left the newspaper on the ground and said," What rubbish is this written? Is the chief secretary of Yuehaiting the murderer? Where is Liyue pavilion and the seven stars? It will be interesting to see how long this reporter can exist ... "But others in Yujingtai turned a deaf ear, and Yuehai Pavilion turned a blind eye, as if the existence of rain had nothing to do with them, and the follow-up was broken like a sinking sea. Moreover, other secretaries of Yuehaiting don't need a few sweet flowers to work overtime and stay up all night happily like rain, so they need to make refreshing strong tea in Qiaoyingzhuang in advance or good coffee and cocoa from Nata. Yujing corrugated frost is heavy, and his covers of kingfisher-blue feel lonelier and colder. Ke Qing doesn't want the rain to bear the name that he shouldn't bear. \n What's more unfavorable is that the death of Emperor Jun has led to the suspension of various moon projects and archaeological excavations for a long time. The workers have no salary to receive, and they suspect that Yu Hengxing is a different person. On the contrary, the stock market in Liyue Port is booming, and people have praised the achievements of Ningguang. Seeing the influence of Engraving declining day by day, it seems that the disappearance of rain is a rehearsal of Engraving. Indecision is not the work of the seven stars. At this moment, Sunny asks herself, "What can we do to break the deadlock?" "
 LYY_New_Event.2.a:0"Ganyu, I'm coming to save you."
 LYY_New_Event.2.b:0"Promote the construction plan of the first phase of Liyue, and the economic boom will inevitably promote the prosperity of Liyue."

 LYY_New_Event.3.t:0"I am rejuvenating and abandoning filth"
 LYY_New_Event.3.d:0""Lord Kering, this is the document to be reviewed today. " \n "Please put it over there." \n The secretary randomly placed two red briefcases in the corner of the carved desk. \n "There is so little work." Carved fine with a sigh, opened one of the briefcase. Notice of suspension of work, compensation for unemployed workers. A lot of troublesome and unnecessary things. Kerching has never hated her job so much. \n "giggle" The secretary opened the door before Kering said "§C ome in". Turning a blind eye to her dissatisfied eyes, the secretary handed her a document. "This is the manuscript that Tianquan's adult wants to make public, please read it and correct it." \nBe proud of it, and then you will pay for it. Carved fine squints at the secretary's arrogant appearance and secretly clenches his fist. She took the document and carefully examined every word on it. While browsing the documents quickly, Ke Qing is also thinking about how to make the workers stop complaining and move the people away from the rainy incident. \n "Yes." Ke Qing picked up a pen and left a line in the column of "New Project Construction in Liyue". "
 LYY_New_Event.3.a:0"Expand the highway from Liyue Port to Guili, and promote economic communication between Liyue and Guangzhou."
 LYY_New_Event.3.b:0"Reduce investment in Liyue Stock Exchange and maintain the order of Liyue."
 LYY_New_Event.4.t:0"Get rid of the false name of unkindness"
 LYY_New_Event.4.d:0"Glass calendar is clear and rainy. In the third prison of Liyueyan: \n "Lord Yuheng, you can't go in!" " \n "Why? What's wrong with my supervision of the trial process? " \n "But. Lord Tianquan has ordered that no one can enter except her old man's house. Lord Yu Heng, it's very difficult for you to be so small. " \n "You tell Ning Guang that she is a seven-star and I am also a seven-star. Why should I follow her? Open the door! " \n "I have reminded Lord Yuheng of you many times, and the consequences of provoking Lord Tianquan are too small to imagine." After that, put it in. Born in a family of dignitaries and highly educated, she was shocked by this scene-there was no natural light in the place where the sun was hard to shine, and the flickering lights seemed to be a horror movie after opening the door of the office area, and there was water leakage between the gaps in the corridor walls. \n Moment Qing touched the wet and cold wall until she came to the end, and opened the heavy iron gate. What she saw inside made her wonder whether she was still in Liyue: \n There were only a few torches in the dark room, and there was a cross-shaped scaffold in the middle, on which Ganyu was tied. Her hands were tightly tied to the ends of the wooden frame by iron wires, and the blood on her wrists blended with the iron wires. Her feet were not on the ground, so that her body was tight, and there were still glazed bags that were chewed out of use at the corners of her mouth. The expensive silk coat of Ganyu has already been carved up, and only the tattered conjoined black silk barely covers the body. The most distressing thing for Kering Qing is the countless whip marks on Ganyu, which makes the original white and tender skin growl with a blue-purple dragon. It is conceivable how inhuman she was tortured here. When Ke Qing stepped forward to have a look at the injury, Gan Yu instinctively shrank his body, whispering, "Don't … Don't hit me … It hurts … I'll say anything … Don't …" \n Seeing the horror of Gan Yu, Ke Qing's nose turned sour and tears left her cheeks. But she soon stopped, and the rain needed a strong one to protect her. She ordered the jailer softly but firmly, "Let her go. Immediately. " \n The jailer looked at each other, but did not act. \n "I said let her go!" The sound of carved sunny is a little louder, so I pull out my sword from my waist, and the sound of surprises is like a thunderbolt hitting the valley. \nThe little jailer timidly muttered, "Heavenly Lord ..." \nKering's anger finally broke out. "When setting light let you abuse lynching? Still * * is the person who is opposite to Yuehai Pavilion? " She put her sword around the jailer's neck. "You don't think yourself hard, do you? I'll count to ten, and if I don't put it, I'll specify that you have no good juice to eat! " \n Hearing the threat of carved sunny, the jailer did not dare to neglect, so too many cooks successfully unloaded the rain from the wooden frame. \n Gan Yu's consciousness was mixed, and he murmured, "Emperor … not … me". "§C arved fine said:"
 LYY_New_Event.4.a:0"Rain, I'm late-"
 LYY_New_Event.5.t:0"Le Mo Le Xi Xin Xiang Zhi"
 LYY_New_Event.5.d:0"Since Gan Yu left the prison on Qingming Day, he took a long vacation to take care of Gan Yu at home and asked Dr. Atractylodes Macrocephala to treat him intimately, but the spirit of Gan Yu can be recovered in a day. When Atractylodes macrocephala was preparing a patent injection of coloured glaze lily for Ganyu, Ganyu recalled his painful memory and burst into tears in an instant, whispering, "I ... didn't ..." Kering had to come forward to comfort Ganyu, wipe away the tears and kiss Ganyu's cheek. Gan Yu settled his mind: "I seem to have had a long dream, surrounded by powerful monsters." I wanted to call the emperor, but I didn't get a response; When I wanted to give up, you appeared in time to save me from danger. Now ..... "Carved fine didn't choose to continue listening, kissing the lip of the rain, although slightly bitter but sweet aftertaste. \n When Dr. Atractylodes macrocephala wanted to leave Kering's home, he was stopped by the oncoming condensate: "Mr. Atractylodes macrocephala, please be calm and come in with me." Later, when Ning Guang saw the carved light just coming out of the bedroom, he said sarcastically, "It turns out that Lord Yuheng, who is hands-on, will also be lazy ... huh?" Carved fine without saying a word, with his fingers pointed to the rain is still in the bedroom. The voice of condensate light is a little weak: "Lord Yuheng will not hesitate to slow down the construction of Liyue Port for this reason." Carved fine with the wave, signal hint atractylodes macrocephala doctor should do more important things. Then he said, "if you think you were right at the beginning, then the rain is the consequence;" The price of pure heart falls again and again, and I don't know how many people are involved; The land between Jueyun was turned over, which almost alarmed the fairy family. Are these all in your plan? " Although Ning Guang was resentful, he said in a low voice: "The stagnation of the development of Liyue Port is the price of the whole incident, and Liyue can't eat such a result." \nYou just can't eat. Carved fine thought, she knew what Ning Guang wanted, and this woman would never give up any Mora. "Setting light, we are all businessmen and know everyone's needs. So, I can come forward and let the price of Qing Xin stabilize. " \n Ning Guang smiled: "Thank you, Lord Yuheng. This kind of work is very heavy, my Lord. Don't work so hard. How about I add a secretary for you? " She pretended to think for a while. "How about Miss Gan Yu?" \n carved sunny also smiled. "
 LYY_New_Event.5.a:0""Thank you very much, Lord Tianquan. " "
 LYY_New_Event.6.t:0"Words with one heart smell like blue."
 LYY_New_Event.6.d:0"Since we reached an oral agreement with Ning Guang, we haven't bothered about carved sunny and sweet rain for several days. At this moment, Ke Qing is also thinking: "What was it because of desperate contradiction with condensate light to save the rain, and what was it because the rain could trust me without complaint?" All these make carved tea rice think. \n "Yu Heng's adult, according to Miss Gan Yu's current situation, Bai has redrafted the prescription. According to the medical list can help the wound heal. " Atractylodes macrocephala walked beside Kering and whispered, so as not to disturb the sweet rain. But I didn't see it for a moment, and the blue-haired fairy beast lying on the couch opened a small crack. Even if Gan Yu is so cautious, Dr. Bai will notice. He quickly stepped forward to see the situation of Ganyu. "Bai has done what the young lady said, so I'll leave first." Time passed quickly, and gradually the lights were on and the night was getting thicker. \n The bathroom of Kering Mansion has been arranged according to the instructions of Atractylodes macrocephala, and the soft lighting combined with special aromatherapy candles exudes irresistible fragrance, making the atmosphere more comfortable. The doctor said that this would help Ganyu's mental recovery. The spacious bathtub in the middle can accommodate more than three people, and naturally it can also accommodate the bodies of two young girls. The thin bodies of Ganyu are carved and slowly carried into the warm bath water. The medicated bath has a slight green color, like a pot of brewed tea, emitting a faint fragrance, turning into dense, rising in the room and slowly filling every corner of the room. Carving a clear body holding the rain, let her lean on her body, the room is full of white fog, the comfortable fragrance of herbs and the warm medicated bath to soothe the mind and body are all excellent ways to relax, but now, it is imperative to help the fortuneteller lean on his arms to clean up his body first. \n Moment Qing gently sniffed the medicinal incense, sprinkled a scoop of water on the scar on Ganyu's shoulder, and Ganyu bit his lower lip: "Lord Yuheng ... it hurts." Carved sunny will rain body immersed deeper, but I don't know that two people are good enough to stick together. Wet hair sticks to the back, and occasionally a few strands are stubbornly entangled with purple hair. The warm pool water makes them gradually relax and forget their fatigue; Mist pervaded and gradually fascinated their eyes. Blurred, carved clear felt his collarbone, chest, lower abdomen and even the following have not been let go, stirred up bursts of spray to cover up the touch of the ankle under the water. Gan Yu's many years' experience in working in the Moon Pavilion made her knock on the carved heart and gallop freely. But carved clear heart is two people's sweet memories. Carved fine will put his left hand around the back of the rain, and his right hand will press the rain into the pool. Whispered lightly chastising: "Xiao Ganyu is really affectionate, don't think I'm …" Gan Yu exclaimed, but he also took advantage of the chaos to get rid of the carved hairstyle. Ganyu grabbed an herb and rubbed the carved cheek, and the blush became thicker like drunkenness, sending an ambiguous message. Carved fine got up close to the earlobe of the rain, gently biting, red lips licking the pink earlobe, licking the ear with the tip of the tongue, and slowly exhaling. Finally, I was reluctant to leave, and the crystal silver line pulled out a milky way in the air. \n The way they are still unfinished after the bath shows that it was not a dream of a single person just now. They are not close but not the same. Carved fine pulling rain lying in his bed, put his cherished feather belt next to the red rope of rain, and lay on the bed to touch his hair ... "

 LYY_New_Event.7.t:0"Dark clouds overwhelm the city"
 LYY_New_Event.7.d:0"Ke Qing is very happy these days, and everything is developing in a good direction. With her company and care, Gan Yu has recovered more than half of her body and can handle paperwork normally. The road construction is getting better and better. She also recruited workers who were unemployed because of work stoppage to carry out the construction, making the progress of the project faster than expected. It is expected that it will be open to traffic before the monthly festival, and the complaints about Yuheng will gradually disappear. However, the gossip about condensation and engraving in Liyuegang has begun to appear. One day, when Ning Guang was at leisure, Wei Fu came to the Pearl Boat Stock Exchange and watched the stock prices rise and fall on the big screens. When he was proud of the prosperity of Liyue under his rule, the unusual rise of an agricultural stock from Jueyun attracted Ning Guang's attention. Her evil spirit smiled, and the opportunity came to bring down Kering. She called her men and whispered a few words. \n "Did you hear? Xianjia is manipulating the stock price! " This message is circulating in the streets and alleys of Liyue. Eyeliner all over Liyue immediately reported to Ning Guang standing on the Jade Pavilion. \n The corners of her mouth are raised by an arc that is hard to find. "Investigate carefully and don't let go of any clues. I want all those who block the development of Liyue to pay the price." Under the intentional guidance, it soon became a fairy spy who undermined the achievements of human governance. A cloud about the fairy family and people is hanging over Liyue ... "
 LYY_New_Event.7.a:0"Dark clouds crush the city and want to destroy it. Take Yulong to Yutai."
 LYY_New_Event.8.t:0"I have no intention of breaking up my family."
 LYY_New_Event.8.d:0""It's raining ..... "Gan Yu looked at the falling rain outside the window, but he lost his mind. She couldn't help walking out of the door, leaning against the fence, watching the rain running down from the cornice, and the smell of fresh grass filled her nose. \n "Are you listening to the rain?" Purple figure came to the side of the rain. "aye? Lord Yu Heng. " She hesitated for a moment, but in hindsight, she said hello to Keqing. \n "How many times have I said, it's called Kerching." The girl with purple hair was slightly angry, and her finger poked lightly on the head of Ganyu, enjoying the expression of Ganyu's panic. "It's beautiful." \n "Gee, it seems that I have come at a bad time." The condensed and tapering voice came, and behind him was a small group of Qianyan army soldiers. Rain eyes dodge, legs and feet a soft, fell in carved sunny arms. Carved fine protect the rain behind him, put his hand on the hilt, and stared at the condensate warily. "What do you want?" \n Condense your hands around your chest: "Do what? As the seven stars, we must protect the safety of Miss Gan Yu. " She raised her voice: "Now there is a storm in the city because of the fairy spy case in Liyue Port, and the people's feelings are surging. It is difficult for us to ensure that Miss Gan Yu will not be threatened." \n "Thank you for your concern, but I can protect myself." Ganyu summoned up his courage and faced the condensed eyes. Ke Qing stepped in the previous step and pulled out his sword again, just like in prison. \n The sound of the sword surprises is like a dragon's song, and a burst of thunder descends as if it were an act of God, so we have to stand back and aim the rifle with a bayonet in our hand at Engraved Sunny. At that time, the tension was tense. \n Ning Guang waved his hand: "Gee, what is this? Hurt the harmony between the seven stars, so that foreign jokes are not, and Lord Yu Heng need not be nervous. It's not that Ganyu suffers from prison, but that Miss Ganyu returns to Yuehai Pavilion to get the most comprehensive protection from Liyue. Soldiers, stand down. " \n Qian Yanjun put away his rifle, and Ning Guang said, "I have no intention of breaking up lovers. This is what God means." "
 LYY_New_Event.8.a:0""Miss Gan Yu, please come with us ""
 LYY_New_Event.9.t:0"It's sweet rain to strive for each other."
 LYY_New_Event.9.d:0"When it was clear, I saw that the condensed light momentum was slightly reduced, and I put away my sword. He said to Ning Guang, "What is beyond you is beyond you?" Gan Yu saw that Keqing and Ningguang were working because of her, and finally released the hand tightly held by Keqing and said to Ningguang, "Lord Tianquan and Lord Yuheng don't have to do this. I know that I am the chief secretary of Yuehaiting, and I should return to Yuehaiting to work again, so I won't give Lord Yuheng any more trouble." Ke Qing's eyes widened: "Ganyu, please don't say impulsive words and succumb to the arrogance of the light." Before the words were finished, Gan Yu grabbed the words: "Thanks to Lord Yuheng's care, but my mind has been made up." Take the opportunity to secretly give carved sunny hand stuffed with a leaf of ice lotus. It's raining hard again, so Ning Guang clapped his hands and said, "Miss Gan Yu, this is the way for Yujingtai to work better. Soldiers, please ask Miss Gan Yu to return to Yuehai Pavilion. " Two female soldiers of Qianyan Army helped Ganyu back to Yuehai Pavilion. \n Everything was as expected by Ning Guang. As soon as Ganyu entered Yuehai Pavilion, Qianyan Army released its support, and Ganyu almost fell. Ning Guang unhurriedly took out a document and read it out: "According to the decree of the transitional government of Liyue, citizen Gan Yu committed the crime of spying on Liyue for manipulating prices and stealing state secrets, and is now imprisoned in Yuehaiting on bail pending trial." Then he pinched Gan Yu's cheek and said softly, "Has Xiao Ganlin forgotten what Li Yue Tessa once said?" After that, Ning Guang went straight away from Yuehai Pavilion. Gan Yu was confused about why this happened and asked Huixin, who is still on duty today, why. \n Huixin saw that the Qianyan army was still patrolling outside and said to Gan Yu's ear, "Lord Gan Yu, you have been cheated by Lord Tianquan. She wants to kill you." Ganyu's heart came out of the blue, but he still looked calm. She didn't look at Huixin, but tilted her head and said in a voice that only they could hear, "Don't be afraid. Go to Lord Yu Heng's office and tell her that everything is going according to plan." After that, I looked at the purple feathers in the black silk and walked into the depths without looking back. Hui Xin saw clearly that Gan Yu raised two fingers to her, which was an emergency signal. Huixin looked at the Thousand Rock Army outside the gate and trotted to the office of Yujingtai carved Qing. Panting, he said, "Yu Heng … Yu Heng's adult, Gan Yu's adult …" Engraved the structural map of Yuehai Pavilion slowly, looked up and said to Huixin, "Secretary Huixin has worked hard, I already know. In addition, do you know the rotation time of the Qianyan Army in Yuehaiting? " Huixin told Ke Qing everything she saw and heard. \n "Thank you very much, Miss Huixin. You should know how to deal with this kind of thing when you are in and out of Yujingtai since childhood. "Purple-haired girl raised her head and stared straight at Huixin. \n "Yes, I didn't see anything today." "
 LYY_New_Event.9.a:0"Soldiers are treacherous."
 LYY_New_Event.10.t:0"We will meet again"
 LYY_New_Event.10.d:0"That night. Underground facilities of Yuehai Pavilion. \n Gan Yu wrote a lot of books in the office prepared by Ning Guang. Ning Guang really fulfilled her promise and met all the needs of Gan Yu. However, Kirin's intuition made her feel that something was wrong, but she had not found anything unusual. \n The clock ticks, and it has pointed to the hour. \n Gan Yu yawned. When I think about it, it seems that I haven't eaten since I was taken to Yuehai Pavilion. I wanted to go out and buy something to eat, just as a Qianyanjun sent a drawer of pure heart flower cakes and a small bottle of sweet flower juice. She has little resistance to these, and she didn't resist eating them all. Then I threw myself into my work, only to find an irresistible tiredness coming. The rain, which has been seriously sleep-deprived, quickly fell asleep on the table. \n "My Lord, I have fallen asleep." The Qianyan Army soldier on duty said. \n "Good, you also go to rest." Ning Guang looked at the tired soldier and said. \n Ning Guang couldn't bear to sleep at his desk when he saw the rain, and once wanted to give up. However, I thought that it was too late to give up halfway, so I decided to take out a document-a confession that Gan Yu "admitted" that he was a fairy spy. The confession is so scrawled that it is hard to believe that it was written by Gan Yu. But handprints don't cheat. \n Hold Ganyu's sleeping hand tightly with his thin hand, take out the inkpad, fix the posture, and then fix the paper. Every step is treading on thin ice, lest the rain suddenly wake up. Fortunately, she slept soundly. At this moment, Ning Guang noticed that the hands moistened by Gan Yu for more than 3,000 years were no different from hers. "Just … press the fingerprint here" Ning Guang said gently on Gan Yu's shoulder, just like a kind mother teaching her children. Ganyu is talking from time to time, and the condensed light gently caresses Ganyu to accompany him to sleep. Later, I saw that the basement was cold, and I personally put a blanket on Ganyu, and then left. \n The next day, Gan Yu's activity space was confined to this office, and he didn't have a tooth for a day. And there are no documents that need to be signed by Gan Yu himself. Until the night falls again, Liyuelight hides behind the clouds, and the algae in front of Liyue pavilion cross. On the occasion of the shift change of Qianyan Army, a bunch of purple movies flashed quickly. "Well. Am I dazzled? " The soldiers at the entrance of Yuehai Pavilion wanted to take a closer look, only to find that they had been stabbed in the throat by a sword in an instant. The last thing a soldier saw was a flashy sword with a strange red light. \n Ziying is like nobody's business in the Moon Pavilion, avoiding every soldier on patrol. On the inevitable road, she will stab everyone present with her sword to ensure that she will not be found. That night, Sagger Long Yin was full of blood. \n Bang-the basement door was opened and Ganyu was still crouching in the corner. I don't have time to think about it. Kerching is pulling the rain and going to the back door of Yuehai Pavilion, where I can leave Liyue Port as soon as possible. At the end of the month, the Thousand Rock Troops patrolling the Yuehai Pavilion discovered the change, and when they were trying to catch up, they met a guest. Ke Qing didn't expect the plan to be carried out so smoothly until he made sure that there was no pursuer. Gan Yu looked at Ke Qing, who was pulling himself to run hard: "Ke Qing, you run slowly. I ... I can't breathe. " Ke Qing also gasped: "At this time ... don't think so much ... it's important to save your life." Later, Ke Qing took out the file marked "V" and a large amount of Mora and said to Gan Yu: "Gan Yu, you go quickly. Today's Liyue Port really can't ensure your safety. Go to Jueyun and Qingce Village. Go to places where the influence of condensation is not so great until you can protect yourself. The file reveals the tip of the iceberg of the condensed light crime, please keep it well. " Gan Yu is already tearful: "Carve … carve fine, then what will you do?" Will we meet again later? " In the corridor of Yuehai Pavilion, Keqing returned with peace of mind after seeing that the two of them were safe. "After a moment's reflection, carved Qing said:"
 LYY_New_Event.10.a:0"We will meet again, I promise."
 LYY_New_Event.10.b:0"Leave it to me. You should take care of yourself."
 LYY_New_Event.11.t:0"Read nine places in the light of the sun, and see your eyes in the floating color."
 LYY_New_Event.11.d:0"The news that Gan Yu fled did not shock Ning Guang too much, on the contrary, she helped Ning Guang's immortal contradiction. The news that "the fairy spy Gan Yu has been permanently expelled from Hong Kong" was reported in newspapers. When Ke Qing saw this, she didn't feel that it was over. On the contrary, the contradiction between Ning Guang and her was no longer concealed. Liyue is in danger of splitting for the first time. \n Every day at the entrance of Yu Hengxing's office, a reporter asks who will be the new helmsman of Liyue. Ke Qing doesn't respond, but silently extends his overtime hours, and gradually gets into the bad habit of having to drink strong tea to work. "I'm afraid I can't cope with this." Kering thought, "It's better to read and relax." Just then, she walked through Bubulu and came to Fei Yunpo. \n Wan Wen Ji She, as the largest bookstore in the whole moon, has all kinds of internal books and albums, and has excellent services that public libraries can't match. Ke Qing looked at the publicity album at the door, ordered a cup of tea and rested in the bookstore. \n The sunshine in early summer came to the ground through the French window, which set each other off with the teenagers with indigo hair reading quietly by the window. "Gump ..." Carved fine wanted to say but took it back. The boy noticed the movement of Ke Qing, turned over a page of the book and said, "Running water does not rot-"\n Ke Qing mused, "My family is not a moth." The teenager snorted: "I didn't expect to meet Lord Yuheng here. I am lucky." \n Seeing that the teenager didn't refuse, Kering randomly pulled out a book from the bookshelf and sat with the teenager by the window. The shadows of indigo and rattan purple in the sun gradually lengthened, and carved a sigh of relief: "I am not the same as Tianquan Star at the moment. Compared with the happy life of the chivalrous man in the book, I feel that I am in a whirlpool. You can't help doing things, and you must feel the same way. " \n Hang Qiu closes the book and gets up from the couch. "Yu Heng's adult, in the whirlpool, the real safe place is not the periphery of the whirlpool. But its center. It's almost the closing time of the Zhuhai Stock Exchange. Let's take a look at the spoils. " \n Kering smiled: "It's better to be respectful than obedient." \n The people on the resplendent cruise ship came from all over Tiwat. They stared intently at the ups and downs of the stock price on the screen, and no one caught a glimpse of the two people in the box. \n Let's get straight to the point: "Lord Kering is looking for a way to counter Lord Tianquan." Carved fine startled by the boy's blunt words, quickly looked around. "A nerd doesn't know how to dispatch troops, but he also knows a thing or two about analyzing the situation." Hangqiu continued: "Today, under the rule of Lord Quan, all resources are tilted towards Liyue Port. Because of this, people are not without complaints, even if it is the nearest return to the original place from Liyue Port. Further afield, people's dissatisfaction is deeper. " \n "Economy is the lifeblood of Liyue and the foundation of Tianquan's adult. As long as the economy falls into recession or even collapses, the influence of Tianquan's adult is only Liyue Port and even her jade pavilion. At that time, the vast underdeveloped areas of Liyue were in your pocket. " \n "Very well said." Carved fine raised his hand and motioned for young stop, "but, I have one thing to correct you. Liyue is not my personal property, but belongs to all the people of Liyue. " "
 LYY_New_Event.11.a:0"There is nothing wrong with such a scale."

 LYY_New_Event.12.d:0"stratum is a huge deep rock, which connects the suburbs of Lisha and Minlin, the west pole of Sumeru City, and the home of Liyue in the south. There is a poem that praises: "A thousand rocks come out of the precious forest, and Hu peeps into the deep rock." . What would the seven stars in Liyue think if the steep land of "ten thousand cannot force it" mutinied one day? \n Bang-a porcelain teacup crashed to the ground. "Hang it all! What do these thugs want to do? Immediately block the news and never let the people and the immortals know. " Ning Guang said plausibly at the Seven Stars Conference, and it is hard to imagine that this is the state of Ning Guang. Yaoguangxing suggested that the fortress on the outskirts of Lisha should be immediately notified to annihilate it nearby, and several other people echoed it. Only carved fine looking at the table layer rock deep-glass sand suburb map without saying a word. Later, Ke Qing stood up and pointed to the pass of Qingxupu and said, "Listen to me, the demands of these troops are not unreasonable, even the same as those of the workers on strike. I can try to negotiate with it on behalf of Qixing, and I won't make the fairy family laugh. " Ning Guang took a sip of tea and said, "Yuheng's plan is too bold. I personally set aside eight divisions as a backup." \n The "thugs" in Ning Guangkou are not quite what Ke Qing thought. They still maintain considerable organization and discipline, which is by no means comparable to the scattered strikers. If they play hardball, they will suffer great casualties. Seeing these soldiers' neat queues, Ke Qing felt that his rhetoric was reasonable, but hoped that they would like to sit at the same table with us ... \n When Ke Qing first entered the "headquarters" of the rebels, he heard "We just want to go home! Why not let me pass? " She walked to the interior of the headquarters, and found that there were also protection maps of the glass sand suburbs and Yunlai Sea hanging on the wall. In an instant, carved fine will know their intentions. But she couldn't be afraid and walked straight to the conference room. An adjutant noticed Ke Qing, who came to negotiate, and stopped her and said, "You must be the representative sent by the Seven Stars. At present, the generals are in a meeting and outsiders are not allowed to enter. Please wait a moment. " Ke Qing was arranged in a temporary waiting room made of rags and wooden boards, and all the tools that might be in contact with the outside world were not collected. It made Ke Qing feel miserable, and time gradually came to the evening. When Ke Qing was almost asleep, he was rudely awakened by the adjutant: "Don't sleep, the general is waiting for you." Carved fine after finishing his skirt quickly into, only to see a few people dressed in military uniforms are eating the dry pot bacon with Jueyun pepper. Ke Qing retreated again and again. The officers noticed the noise made by Ke Qing and put down their chopsticks. One of them said, "You must be Yuhengxing from Liyue. I didn't expect that we were lucky enough for the seven stars to meet us." Another man handed me a baked potato and said, "I heard that Lord Yuheng likes to eat and live with foot soldiers, so I specially gave him a baked potato today." Ke Qing had no choice but to express her gratitude for her behavior. During the negotiation, these soldiers spoke frankly about their ambitions for the Seven Stars and even the whole moon, but Yu Heng's demands were considered as naive fantasies. The general still has wine to drink when she is excited, so she can only chew potatoes repeatedly to relieve it. "Negotiations are useless and they must be eradicated as soon as possible." Carved fine thought, and walked out of the meeting room, completely ignoring the "blueprint" that the generals were still drawing. \n Moment Qing felt wronged inside, but she didn't talk about it and was laughed at. She left the headquarters angrily and noticed several soldiers chatting around the campfire. She had a brainwave, "Listen to what they are saying, maybe there are unexpected gains." She sat quietly next to the soldiers, and the night covered her with purple sideburns. The similar military uniforms prevented her from being recognized quickly. Ke Qing quietly listened to the original state of the soldiers' families, how they were discriminated against by civil servants every day, and how they were bullied by officers ... Someone found Ke Qing without saying a word: "Female soldiers are not allowed to come to the front line in the army, so go back to logistics." "What female soldier? This is clearly Lord Yu Hengxing." As soon as this statement came out, several soldiers around him put down their work and gathered around to see the carved beauty. \n Kering didn't show shyness, but stood up and spoke boldly out of the original plan: "Lord Tianquan has specially allocated condolence money to your family in consideration of the pain of the cancelled holiday. And your family doesn't know about your departure from the station yet. The purpose of this trip is not to return home, but to Yujingtai; You should not and cannot be meaningless numbers, whether you are used as cannon fodder on the steps or fighting for yourself. It's up to you! " After listening to the soldiers, they talked about it in succession. Kering sat down and chatted with the soldiers for a few words and then quietly left. That night, carved fine words spread to every mutinous soldier, while the drunken generals were still dreaming. \n The next day, when Ke Qing tried to negotiate again, she found that the soldiers at the checkpoint had a different attitude towards her than yesterday, and even secretly saluted her. Ke Qing found that many soldiers had red ribbons on their arms. When she approached the "headquarters", she found that it was heavily guarded. Just when she was confused, a soldier saluted her: "Never mind, you must be the official with purple hair who came yesterday. Now that this place has been controlled by the Soldiers' Committee, please let me explain the situation to you. " Ke Qing's words last night were like a spark, and now they have started a prairie fire. The soldiers led her into the "headquarters". In the room with only a few lights, the supercilious officers were blind and tied to chairs by soldiers. Carve a clear heart and be dark.Her plan is smoother than expected. \n She approached one of the officers. He kept his head open and his eyes flashed, avoiding the clear sight. Kering turned the officer's head to her and forced him to stare at himself. She announced her verdict word for word: "Protect the country for leaving home, and return to Xinjiang for returning home. Qianyanjun's wish is not to mix any impurities. And you ... defiled it. " \n Kering opened the holster, pulled out the exquisite pistol, and opened the safety bolt. \n Bang-bang-without exception, send them where they should go. The soldiers raised their arms, and the red ribbon gradually merged with the sunset. "

 LYY_New_Event.13.d:0"Ke Qing successfully quelled the follow-up work of the incident, only to find that solatium, who had promised to give her family, was far more than Ke Qing's annual income, and she could not cope with it at all. In order to avoid breaking his promise, Kering had to seek a solution from Ningguang. Ning Guang looked at Zhu Dianfang's transaction report, listened to Ke Qing casually and complained about his embarrassment. He smoked a cigarette and said, "Why should we easily promise what the country can't do? If today's soldiers in Jiyan Juyuan mutiny can get money, who will pay compensation if the soldiers at the entrance of Yujingtai tomorrow mutiny?" Ke Qing bowed his head in silence, feeling that he was laughed at in public. Ning Guang put down his statement and said, "It's not impossible for me to come forward to solve it, but you see that the high housing prices in Liyue Port affect the capital turnover of the stock market and solve it within 10 days." \n Kering looked at Ning Guang and toyed with his pipe and thought, "Ten days? Let me declare bankruptcy. " But on the surface, I reluctantly agreed to the task of condensing light. \n After leaving the Jade Pavilion, Kering didn't want to return to Yujingtai. It is impossible to cover the complicated situation in several sets of data. She wandered aimlessly in the street until she heard a familiar voice in the Liuli Pavilion. "What a coincidence, Lord Yuheng!" Walnut greeted him kindly. "How about having dinner together?" Ke Qing saw the clock around Walnut winked at her, and then readily agreed. \n Different from the past, Walnut nodded to all expenses of Zhong Li, and the table was full of delicious food. "Hall Lord is in a good mood today. Is there anything happy? " Carved fine asked with puzzle. "Yes, every day, people enjoy happiness in advance because they can't afford the mortgage, and we will never worry about no performance in going to Shengtang again!" Walnut clapped his hands and laughed. \n carved Qing picked up a piece of pine mushrooms and asked Zhong Li, "I wonder if Mr. Zhong ever had a clever plan to solve the problem of high real estate?" Zhong Li swallowed the food in his mouth and said, "Zhong did not know how to lobby the Liyue assets headed by Feiyun Chamber of Commerce to do good deeds, so let's eat first." \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n But Kering never understood why securities were more convenient than Mora. Until she saw the clock leaving the previous checkout, she waved her hand and said, "The account goes to the health hall." At present, I told the clerk, "Pay by securities, with midday shares as the cut-off point, and calculate the discount of Mora's share price." \n Zhong Li, who got the receipt, turned to Ke Qing and said, "Lord Yuheng is busy with the construction of Liyue, so he should know the benefits of securities to Liyue's economy. Even if he doesn't talk to the emperor about politics, he won't say much. " \n Zhong Li, who is regarded as the orderly, makes Ke Qing feel that he is the obstacle to the change of Liyue. At this time, Walnut inserted: "Lord Yuheng doesn't usually use securities much, so he will be familiar with it if he uses it more." After pulling the clock away, I said goodbye to carved sunny. \n After satiated with food and wine, Kering decided to take a break at Wanwen Club. She sipped her tea slowly, and noticed that people in the street settled all their transactions with a piece of paper, recalling what Zhong Li had just said. At that time, the familiar blue-haired boy sat next to her. \n "Now the use of securities is more than Mora's, but the antiques in the Chamber of Commerce are indifferent to' condensed toys' and cling to their old jobs." The teenager said simply. \n "I have a bad feeling about this." \n "That's right. The biggest variable in trading securities is that it is only related to the prestige of Tianquan's adult. Once the authority of heaven is severe and difficult to recover, the consequences will be unimaginable. Whether it is a fairy who lives in seclusion or a foreign country that covets the wealth of Liyue, it has an indelible injury to the rule of Liyue. " \n The two chatted for a long time, and it was not until the lights were on that it was clear to say goodbye to Hangqiu ... "

 LYY_New_Event.14.d:0"Liyue Port is a city that never sleeps, and neon lights illuminate the night sky and put out the fire of crime. Ke Qing strolled through the street and caught a glimpse of the man running into the dark alley in the distance, but nothing happened after a round of intensive gunfire. Curiosity drove carved fine gather together in the past to see, but suddenly covered her eyes in white, and her mouth was covered with a hand. She felt a woman saying in her ear, "Don't look at what you shouldn't see, don't listen to what you shouldn't hear, and so does everyone, including Qixing." After carved fine recognized the voice of night orchid, she nodded stiffly. After a while, white clothes and women dissipated in the night air, leaving only a rut mark. \n Is there such a way for people to rule the glass moon in its heyday? Are the condensed hands pure? Knowing the style of night orchid's work, I can imagine it, knowing that condensation will kill me. Carved fine recalled the people and things that happened during the day and decided to look for a rescue method from Zhong Li. \nDying Hall is one of the most taboo places for Liyue people, and Kering is no exception. But she knew it was her hope. As usual, she came to the side door and "knocked" to the people inside. The response she wanted soon came, "Ouch, here comes the business!" A lively female voice came from inside, accompanied by footsteps approaching. "Don't wait." The mature male voice prevented further action. "In general reason, the bearer didn't deliver the' wooden sign, so it is estimated that he was entrusted with something else." \n The side door opened a crack, and when I saw the girl's expectant face, I frowned and whispered, "Walnut, I'm here to see Mr. Zhong Li, not a customer." Walnut is a little depressed, but it still lets Kering in. \n Zhong Li seems to expect a party. The teapot on the table is scattered with pure petals, and some of them leave the original shortbread. "Is it important for Lord Yuheng to call at home late at night?" Ke Qing sat in a chair and drank tea nervously: "Mr. Zhong Li, the task of regulating housing prices that I said today is already impossible. What are your countermeasures?" \n Zhong Li sipped tea ceremony: "What has been done is not lost, but what has not been done is not allowed. For example, today Quan Xing is expanding his influence to the whole country of Liyue, and at the same time burying the seeds of the crisis. " \n He got up from his chair, took out a "Rock Harbor Evening News" and spread it out in front of Kering. On the front page, it read "Fairy spies have traces of activities in Qingce Village recently". \n carved clear heart relieved. Pointing to the headline, Zhong Li said, "I know that adults robbed Qin criminals of their heroic spirit in Yuehai Pavilion, but these alone can't cope with the treacherous Liyue Port. Now adults need to save their strength." Ke Qing suddenly realized and thanked Zhong Li: "Your words are like an awakening, but there are eyes of Tianquan all over Liyue. Where can I be accommodated?" \n "Excuse me, does Miss Kering have a map with her?" Clock from suddenly asked 1. Ke Qing nodded, took out the scroll he carried with him and said, "This is a sketch I used in general engineering construction, but it is enough." I saw two people pointing at the engineering drawings. Zhong left his hand and pointed lightly at Cezhuang: "Although this is the pivot of the northern border of Liyue, it is too far away from Liyue Port, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive." Looking at Jueyun again, he mused, "It's a place where immortals practice. Although there are industrial and mining benefits, they will send people to live in exile." Ke Qing looked at Qingxupu and said, "I was trying to quell the mutiny. Is it appropriate to use it here?" Zhong Li shook his head and put the teacup here: "The black rock factory in the suburb of Lisha is adjacent to the layered rock, where Liyue founded the country. Ningguang will surely wipe out the thieves who are separated here at once, so it is not appropriate to get into trouble." Ke Qing said thoughtfully, "Where is the real promised land? Is it a return to the original or a lonely cloud pavilion hanging overseas? " Zhong Li handed a piece of shortbread to Ke Qing: "As you said, I left my home in Liyue. The execution of condensate light will not be very strong and has a certain foundation, and the railway hosted by adults will also be easy to move. " While they were talking, Walnut came in. He took the shortbread in Kering's hand and ate it: "Kering is going to return to the original? That's where my father often takes me, and I have some acquaintances there who can help you. How about it? " Put on a show of wanting to be sure. "Well, it seems that there has been a beginning. Maintaining the order of the Millennium is no longer suitable for Liyue, and the time for change has come. Do you want to start with me? " \n Nine days later, Ke Qing was removed from Yu Hengxing's post because she could not settle the house price incident, but she was not sad. Because there is a new story written at the North Railway Station of Liyue Port ... "

The storm also quickly spread to the original place, making the labor shortage in small cities worse. Ke Qing works in a radio station with an anonymous surname, reporting the chaotic state of various places in Liyue, and Ning Guang's plan to save the city and maintain stability ended in failure again and again. She knew it was time. \n Under the watchful eyes of Zhong Li and Xing Qiu, she turned on the radio. "Good evening, people who have left the original and even the whole moon. Welcome to today's broadcast. As of 18: 00 tonight, Wujuepo, Shimen and Mingyun Town have temporarily lost contact with Liyue Port, and listeners who want to go to Mond recently need to postpone their plans; According to the news from Yujingtai, Lord Tianquan commanded the economic organizations in Liyue to win in stages, and the capital fled in the winter. Recently, prices will rise slightly, and the economy will recover in an orderly way ... "Carving Qing's heart is bleeding when she reads the manuscript that runs counter to reality, and her eyes can't stop spinning. She decided that she can't submit to humiliation any longer." Hello, everyone, I'm former Yuhengxing, Carving Qing. I appeal to all those who care about the history of the country and who seriously think about the future of the country. Please don't be blinded by false news. Look around you! How many people are homeless and displaced because they can't pay their loans; How many people are hungry and naked because there is no Mora. " \n "Please think about it, who is the person who caused Li Yue to sink into this situation? Unfortunately, it was the emperor himself who simply pulled out the seven-star group of Liyue, headed by Tianquanxing. They don't think about the lonely plight of the glass moon, but carrying faggots to put out a fire tried to throw Mora into the bottomless pit with a drop in the bucket, and personally ruined the glass moon that the emperor had protected for thousands of years ... "Carved sunny here choked me, and tears swirled in her eyes. "Comrades, friends, we would like to see the glass month to slump? No! We have no room for concession any more. We must take action, which is neither to be an enemy of Li Yue nor to gain benefits for ourselves in any form. But an urgent need to find a way to save the country, a way to get rid of depression and poverty, and a brand-new way without the control of condensation light and the threat of the night orchid secret police. Therefore, we need to devote our limited life to the infinite liberation of the people of Liyue. To establish a free and democratic Republic that truly belongs to the people! " Ke Qing just turned off the radio and found a lot of people gathered downstairs. Hang Qiu hurried downstairs to check the news, followed by carved fine, and found that they were moved by carved fine's words of wholeheartedly serving the country, and voluntarily took an adult ladder to push carved fine to the door of the original city hall. Under the stage is an ocean of jubilation, and on the stage is a prepared podium. She couldn't restrain her inner feelings and shouted: "Comrades, the great journey has just begun. We need to liberate our destiny from the condensed light! The Seven Stars Revolutionary Committee of Liyue was formally established! " "

Soon, the problem of population shortage has been solved. \n After solving the population problem, we need to think about it. How can we make good use of these people? Xing Qiu and Zhong Li have different opinions. From the economic point of view, the current population is saturated, and these people can be mobilized as the army to protect the fruits of the people's revolution. Zhong Li considered that these people were not attached to the Committee soon after returning to the original place, and rashly joining the army or becoming an administrator might disturb the order, and proposed that these people should join the team of returning to the original place. "After a moment's silence, she finally decided:"

Although she works overtime every day, she will not be exhausted; Nowadays, all departments of the Seven-Star Revolutionary Committee need to read it, and often working overtime until early morning may not solve the problem of the day. One ugly day, Ke Qing was still planning how to reduce the loss of civil war and build a new moon. Suddenly, she fainted on the ground for no reason, and Ke Qing had a real and fantastic dream. She walked in the forest where she left home in a banquet dress. At first, the trees were flourishing and the road was narrow enough for only one person to pass. After several steps, I suddenly saw the ancient pavilion standing in the middle. There is a table, a stove and a woman in the pavilion. Tea is baked on the stove, and there are chess on the table. The woman is not surprised to see the arrival of carved sunny, but invites carved sunny to play chess. Seeing that "Li Yue Millennium" has been carved several times, I found that the woman was slowly making her own arrangements, but she was in a hurry to ignore the overall layout. I was deeply surprised by the carving, so I asked the woman about the mystery. The woman took no time to make a cup of tea for carved Qing, who keenly found that the glass lily in the cup was exactly the same as her headdress. \n Keqing took a sip of tea and said, "There are few people who make tea with glazed lilies in Liyue now. Although the taste is unique, it is a kind of gluttony." The woman smiled without a word, saw the identity of the seven stars on her body, and filled the tea. Ke Qing added: "Immortals have been protecting you for thousands of years, and now Liyue is very different, and people need to change. But the immortals resisted change, and there was a lot of resistance inside the Seven Stars. Am I wrong? " The woman picked a petal and put it in carved hands: "Your actions may not be wrong, and they may not be right. Change takes time and cannot be held back by temporary setbacks. " Ke Qing smelled the fragrance of the glass lily on the woman's body, and recalled that she had read the description of the death of the dust god in the book when she was young. She continued: "Today's Tianquan adults are bent on attracting investment regardless of the status quo and ignoring the local development of Liyue. Only a few people in Liyue are rich because of this. Is this what you want to see? " Finally, I drank all the tea in my cup, hid my face and smiled: "I didn't expect to deceive you, but I can't answer your question directly." Ke Qing asked again, "Do you know that the endangered plants have only been planted in a small amount in Liyue Port since they left the original mountains and plains? What should be done?" Finally, I kissed the carved forehead and said, "You just need to sign a contract with me, and then the problem will not be difficult." I saw that I took out a paper document-"Return to the original and the glass lily" and then left. When I wanted to say a few more words, I found myself in the hospital, and I knew it when I saw the picture of the starry sky eclipsing the rising sun outside the window. "

 LYY_New_Event.18.d:0"Heavy sea or heavy land has been discussed since Emperor Jun created Liyue Port. The emperor built one fortress after another in the territory of Liyue, and stationed a large number of Qianyan troops. At sea, there was only one solitary Yunge fortress to decorate Liyue Port. Today, the neighboring countries of Liyue, such as Fengdan, Daofu and Mond, are all developing maritime affairs, and the status of the Southern Cross Fleet supported by Ningguang is prominent, making it the place with the highest salary for soldiers outside the martial arts commission. Under the shadow of every month, the Southern Cross Fleet is struggling. Can the "§C ondensed hair" be glorious? \n On the Jade Pavilion, I was staring blankly at the yellow and decaying flower beds outside the window. \n "Lord Tianquan, Miss Beidou is here." \n Without waiting for Ning Guang's response, the captain walked into the office. She looked at the woman in front of her with a little surprise. How can this look like a "heavenly right"? The hairpin is simply fixed on her hair and almost falls off. Her face is full of sadness, her uniform is full of wrinkles, and she has a smoking pipe in her hand. She doesn't look like a qualified leader at all. \n "Ning Guang, I can't see you in high spirits." Beidou couldn't help saying. \n "I can't see either." Ning Guang looked up at Beidou, and then coughed violently. At that time, the foul smoke filled the captain's mouth and nose. "Wow, you smoke something. "\n Ning Guang waved his hand to signal Beidou not to ask questions, and then said," Come on, if you have something. "\n" Um ... Okay. "She scratched her head awkwardly:" Now there are not so many caravans to protect, and there are so many brothers to raise, so ... "\n Ning Guang took a breath full of smoke, stood up on the back of the chair and fiddled with the paintings behind her. Beidou noticed that all her valuables were gone. A big bag of Mora fell to the ground in the gap between the paintings, which instantly alerted the secretaries at the door. Beidou shouted: "Stand down!" Then I watched Ning Guang pick up the bag trembling and handed it to Beidou. I said with great anger, "Take it, this is my last money as Ning Guang. Perhaps alleviate the urgent need. " Beidou didn't want to answer: "What would you do if I took it?" Ning Guang managed to squeeze out a smile: "I don't need it. "Give the bag to the captain with the same haggard face. After some hesitation, she accepted. "I can't ask for your things for nothing. What can I do for you?" After a long time, Ning Guang spoke slowly: "Can I lean on your shoulder?" Beidou nodded and opened his hands. \n There was no sound when Ning Guang cried, but Beidou could feel her tears streaming down her cheeks and wet her shoulders. The captain patted the condensed back, just like twenty years ago. Over the years, Beidou has never seen such a fragile condensate. In her eyes, Ning Guang has always been synonymous with "strength". She was silent, just hugged the woman in her arms and gave her a little long-lost warmth. \n It took a long time for Ning Guang to gently break away from the embrace of Beidou and restore his original appearance: "Let's not meet here again." Beidou couldn't bear to see the condensation again, so he had to agree. Looking at the back of Beidou gradually blurred, I couldn't help myself with tears. With the closing of the gate of the Jade Pavilion, Beidou saw that the Jade Pavilion, which was once at the top of Liyue, had no scenery of the world. She walked to the south military port of Liyue in a trance, and the crew noticed that Beidou's expression had dissipated what little optimism was left. Beidou took off his blindfold and handed it to the fleet accountant: "Take this blindfold and go to Liyue Bank to take out my money for my brothers. The story of the Southern Cross may come to an end. " Fengyuan Wanye dropped his leaf and said to Beidou, "How can the great ship of the Southern Cross abandon the ship because it ran aground for a while? The brothers are willing to continue to follow the big sister." The ideal is lofty, but it is difficult to realize it. The Southern Cross Fleet finally gave up most of its ships, leaving only the death sign asterisk, Beidou, Wanye and hundreds of crew members. They wandered aimlessly on the sea, looking for a place to live. It is said that the price of materials in Guiyuan is much lower than that in the surrounding areas, and the Southern Cross Lone Star came to Guiyuan with their only Mora, which is indeed as reported by the wind. "Beidou? How did you end up here? " Hangqiu was surprised by the arrival of Beidou Wanye, but what was even more unexpected was that he could recognize the appearance of Beidou and Wanye. \n Beidou, under the leadership of Hangqiu, changed his view on returning to the original and even the whole Liyue, and Hangqiu attributed many changes of returning to the original to the people of Liyue. Beidou implicitly revealed the situation of the Southern Cross Fleet, and in autumn, it also directly let several people meet with carved Beidou. At first, Ke Qing was not friendly to people from Liyue Port, especially those around Ningguang, and even a little wary. Ke Qing changed the number in his hand again and again, and finally said to Beidou: "In fact, I can't afford such a fleet, and I won't give in to the crime of heavenly rights." Hearing this, Beidou plopped down on his knees and said with tears flashing to Kering, "No amount of Mora can survive in troubled times, not to mention that we are all people of Liyue. I haven't asked for help in Beidou for several years. Today, I beg Lord Yuheng to spare Ning Guang's life. She won't die. " Like the Beidou on the Jade Pavilion watching the condensed light, Kering has never seen Beidou so fragile. Wanye was crying silently, and Hangqiu wanted to help Beidou. \n In the frosty morning, the horseshoe is broken and the horn is swallowed. Carved fine will Beidou mixed up, wipe away the tears. Approximate to the rain.Say to Hangqiu: The submission of the Southern Cross Fleet is decided by the Committee. Let Big Sister Beidou and Brother Wanye go to rest first. They haven't had enough to eat for some time. \n In the end, the Revolutionary Committee welcomed the Southern Cross and sent people to receive it from the home port of the fleet-Guyunge. The situation of condensation and engraving has completely changed! One morning, Ke Qing and Wan Ye talked, and the core content was: "
 LYY_New_Event.18.a:0"With the long tassel in hand today, when will the heavenly rights be bound?"
 LYY_New_Event.18.b:0"It's like sweeping a thousand troops, so what can we do step by step!"

 LYY_New_Event.19.d:0"Lord Kering, according to the latest information, there are few troops left in Ningguang, and there is a gap in the defense line of Liyue Port." Maple original ten thousand leaves handed the latest investigation report to carved fine. \n "Good news! Thank you, Wanye. " It is hard to hide the excitement when it is carved, and the voice can't help but rise a few degrees. "Immediately prepare for Red October. Now, as long as we are at the end of the day, the ruined regime will collapse, and Liyue that truly belongs to the people is coming!" \n The order to launch a general attack was issued soon, and an hour later, the armored train "Red October" was ready to go at the original railway station. Countless people crowded outside the station, scrambling to see the true face of this black dragon, and then awed by its 16-section huge body, large and small artillery and homing machines all over the body, and the fearsome 280 mm train gun. Ke Qing reviewed hundreds of soldiers who fought alongside her on the platform and boarded the train. With her command, the steel behemoth spit out thick black smoke and broke through all obstacles slowly under the whistle. At the front end, the huge red rock element symbol is particularly eye-catching. \n The movement of "Red October" has been known by Ning Guang just after its departure. She hurriedly ordered the fortresses along the railway to concentrate their fire and destroy them, and blew up the tracks so that the trains could not pass. However, Ning Guang was horrified to find that all ambush attacks on it would be turned into dust under the powerful firepower of armored trains, which could not hurt them at all, and the strong fortifications of the fortress would be abruptly knocked open by giant guns. What makes her even more desperate is that even if the tracks are blown up, it can only slightly delay the progress of the "Red October", because the railway workers spontaneously organized and repaired the tracks at an incredible speed. \n The next night, "Red October" has arrived at Tianquan Fortress. This fortress named after Ningguang is the last line of defense in Liyue Port, so the garrison here is particularly strict. Anyone who wants to break this fortress is bound to crash and burn. Ke Qing knew that there was little chance of a hard collision between the train and his own troops, and he thought about how to defeat the enemy without fighting all night. When she was at a loss, she decided to take a walk on the roof. Sitting on the top of the front turret, Ke Qing looked around with binoculars, and soon found something unusual: sporadic fire came out around the fortress at the top of the mountain, gunshots came in the distance, and the huge shore defense turret was silent. What happened? Confused, she ordered the train to stop and wait and see. After about an hour, the fire dissipated, a red flag rose, and the soldiers in the fortress rebelled. The "Red October" was able to pass through the defense gate unscathed, and the last obstacle to the March to Liyue Port was eliminated. \n On Tianquan Fortress, the train gun aimed a huge muzzle at Yujingtai. This night will make history. "Lord Kering, the artillery has entered the predetermined position, and the shooting of the elements is ready to be completed, at your command." Wanye reports to Kering. \n "Good. Then, let off the fireworks of the revolution! " \n With the dazzling fire and deafening roar, a cannon bounced out of the chamber, streaked a red track in the night sky of Liyue Port, and then bloomed in the air-the world will always remember this history-making cannon.

 LYY_New_Event.20.d:0"Ning Guang collapsed in a chair and looked at the front with empty eyes. Everything is over, and any resistance is meaningless. Beidou blocked the port of Liyue from the sea to prevent speculators from escaping; When Zhong Li landed from Tianheng Mountain, the transitional government in Liyue couldn't give any orders. The only thing she can do now is to wait for her ending. She looked at herself in the mirror, and immediately don't overdo it. She knew that she would never look like a star again. \nIt doesn't take long to set the light. An hour later, a group of soldiers burst through the door and surrounded her. Then, a purple-haired woman came in, walked up to her and said slowly, "Tianquan, you are defeated. "\n Like being freed, Ning Guang gave a bitter smile to her former colleagues. "

 LYY_New_Event.21.d:0"Kering sat on the plaintiff's bench and looked at the condensed light curled up in the dock. Her haggard face has long lost its expression, leaving only sorrow and fear. The red eyes, which are condensed and turbid, are opposite to the four eyes, and she knows very well that the prisoner is begging for his pity. Even Beidou, who is famous for her strength, sobbed in the gallery, and her deputy comforted her softly beside her. \n "All of you stand up, and the defendant condenses ... According to the General Principles of the Civil Law of Liyue ..." The judge read out the draft document with a straight face, and the Beidou tissue was wet. "Sentenced to labor reform for 12 months. If you do not obey the judgment, you can appeal again." The judge struck the gavel three times. Ning Guang sat there motionless. She couldn't believe her ears. She pinched her thigh, and the pain immediately showed that she was not dreaming. At the moment when Ning Guang was taken out of the Jade Pavilion, the relationship between self-belief and Engraving was certain to die, but the sound of interpretation shattered Ning Guang's illusion. Ke Qing stood up from his seat: "Man is not an emotionless money-making machine. Please cherish this opportunity." Ning Guang looked up without saying a word, and at the moment when he was taken away by the bailiff, he gave a long-lost smile to Ke Qing. "

 LYY_New_Event.22.d:0"Ye Lan sat in the dock, her face full of disdain, ignoring the plaintiff's gaze. When the judge read the verdict one by one, she said nothing and silently fiddled with her slightly faded dice. \n "Defendant Ye Lan ... was sentenced to three years and four months' imprisonment according to the' Liyue Criminal Law' ... If he did not obey the judgment, he could appeal on an optional basis." Ye Lan stood up from his seat and said, "The condensed light is still too weak. If it were me, you wouldn't even have time to confess your sins. What court? It' s just a drama that attracts power. " She looked straight at Kering, and her bright green eyes were also judging her. If the eyes could kill people, Kering would have been cut to pieces. Ye Lan gnashed her teeth and said word for word: "I regret it ... I regret that I shouldn't have killed you without hesitation!" " "Keqing swallowed her anger and said to Ye Lan,

 LYY_New_Event.23.d:0"§C arved fine opened the heavy prison door, and the prisoners inside were handcuffed and shackled and tied to a bench behind their backs. She was very angry and her joints were clicking, but her reason told her to calm down. She walked up to Ye Lan, gritted her teeth and asked word for word, "Did you hang Gan Yu on that scaffold?" \n "So what?" The woman with blue hair gave a "poof" sneer and said sarcastically, "Not only that, but I also interrogated her myself. Is it expected? " Without saying a word, the bench beneath her turned into a pile of sticks, and she fell to the floor. The nightmare began. \n A rubber stick appeared on Kerching's hand. "Let's experience the pain that the rain has suffered." \n Ye Lan couldn't see the movement of engraving, but her body gave feedback honestly. There was a burning stabbing pain in the elbow, thigh, back and abdomen, which was a piece of cake for Ye Lan. She closed her eyes and enjoyed the strange pleasure brought by the pain. Carved fine gave her a contemptuous look. \n "Uh-!" There was an extremely sharp stabbing pain in the lower abdomen, which made Ye Lan open her eyes and curl her body. She coughed up one mouthful blood and gasped heavily, and her carved foot still stepped on her lower abdomen. \n "Do you know what pain means?" \nThe next nightmare begins, and Kering's next kick kicks her in the ribs, then her stomach, then her private parts, and then her spine. In contrast, the rubber stick can be described as gentle. Night orchid couldn't help screaming, rolling on the ground, trying to avoid punching and kicking, but it was useless except for adding carved anger in vain, and more fists fell on her. What makes Ye Lan even more afraid is that she can't lose consciousness under endless punching and kicking. Until I don't know how long later, she fell motionless on the slate of her cell like a bag of potatoes. Someone came in to test her pulse, check her nerve reaction, turn her eyelids, and felt rough fingers on her body to see if there were any broken bones, and gave her an injection on her arm, which made her fall asleep. "

 LYY_New_Event.24.d:0"Ye Lan woke up in the darkness and immediately understood her state. He was fixed on the bed, and his mouth was stuffed with a mouth ball. Years of work experience has trained her ability to listen to the sound in the dark, and she can hear the rubbing of high-heeled shoes with the floor and the clang of iron doors. \n The newcomer tore open the blindfold of Ye Lan, and the sudden light blinded her. The woman with purple hair first entered the sight of Ye Lan. Later, mouth ball also took it off, carved fine with playful eyes looked at her mouth breathing. "Is it comfortable?" She has an instrument with a lever on it, and there is a circle of numbers on the surface of the instrument. \n Ye Lan tried to move her hand, but as expected, she did not move. "That's all." \n The carved hand moved slightly, and then, without warning, Ye Lan felt a fierce pain spread all over her body, and the pain was daunting, which she had never felt before. Although she felt very enjoyable, her body still twitched uncontrollably, and beads of sweat on her forehead soaked her hair. Night orchid bite a tooth without making a sound. \n "Oops? Is this the limit? " Ke Qingyi smiled and said, "These methods are much gentler than torturing prisoners." Night orchid looked back at carved sunny, but couldn't say a word in pain. \n Pull the lever back in a quarter of an hour, and the pain will soon subside, as fast as it happened. "Now is forty, the instrument can have a maximum of one hundred, in short, your life is in my hands. During our conversation, if you are mystifying or playing dumb, I can make you cry out in pain. \nDo you understand? " No one can dig out even a little information from Ye Lan's mouth. \n "You should reflect on why you are so incompetent and want me to say a word. You are still too young. " Night orchid wants to tilt her head, but she is fixed by chains. Carved fine cold hum a: "We'll see. You will regret it. " \n "Answer me, did you concoct the Moon Pavilion case?" Carved fine raised questions. \n Ye Lan didn't bother to answer, and then there was a sharp pain, and the pointer on the instrument turned to 55. She was sweating, as if her life would be over in the next second. Even if you give yourself more psychological hints, Ye Lan can't help it. Kerching pulled the lever back, but the pain was only slightly relieved. "say." Night orchid still said nothing. \nThe pointer has turned to sixty, sixty-five, and seventy. Ye Lan suddenly opened her eyes and closed them, trying to divert the pain. The pain became more and more severe, even so, she still said nothing. However, with the ray element eroding every inch of her body, she can't hold on much longer. \n Ye Lan suddenly screamed and closed her eyes. The great sense of electricity made Ye Lan in a trance in the middle of the ice sheet, and the wind was blowing hard. Night orchid wants to curl up to keep warm, but her body can't move, and tears can't help flowing with saliva. Ye Lan wants to embrace warmth and be cared for. Carved fine also just loosen the lever to embrace the night orchid. At that moment, the pain was foreign, from other sources, and only carved Qing would save her from the pain. But as consciousness returned to her body, she felt a chill over the woman holding her. Night orchid shook her body, trying to break away from the arms of carved sunny. She is disgusted with the woman who once beat herself up in front of her. \n "Good boy." The carved voice rang from her ear, and the pain subsided. "Don't be afraid, say it." \n "It's ... it's setting light ... she ... she ordered me to do it ..." Ye Lan responded with some inarticulate words. \n "That's unfortunate." Ke Qing shook his head and said softly, "Bad children who lie will be punished ~ Come again." \n The shackles on Ye Lan were tightened again, and she felt another pain, which closed her eyes. The pointer rose to about eighty or ninety. She can only remember intermittently why it hurts so much, and her consciousness seems to be dissipating. \n "Who is it?" \n "Only ... there is ... me." \n "Better. Really embarrassed. " A needle plunged into Ye Lan's arm, and suddenly the pain dissipated and the warmth spread all over the body. She opened her eyes and looked at carved sunny with tears in her eyes. Ye Lan has never loved the woman in front of her so much, not only because she stopped her pain, but also because she has a strange feeling brewing in her heart. \n Two slightly moist cushions clamp the temple of Ye Lan. She shrank and felt a little pain, but it was completely different from before. Kerching put her hand on the back of her hand to reassure her, and her tone was very kind. \n "There will be no pain this time." Carved fine said. "Keep your eyes on me." \n Then there was an explosion. Although there was no sound, Ye Lan felt a flash, which made her unable to open her eyes. There was no harm this time, just let her sleep. "
 LYY_New_Event.24.a:0"Just sleep"
 LYY_New_Event.25.t:0"Who am I"
 LYY_New_Event.25.d:0"Ye Lan was handcuffed to a chair again. However, the management has been loose recently, and she has a certain time to move freely every day. Instrument no longer makes Ye Lan feel afraid. In carved description, it is a tool to punish bad children. At that time, it was mostly because her head was not working, and it was a kind reminder. How long did their conversation last? Ye Lan can't remember. It may be weeks or months. \n Ye Lan told everything without reservation. Whether it is the false testimony of Gan Yu or the assassination of the opponents of Ning Guang, all of them confessed to Ke Qing. She found it hard to refuse to answer the carved question. Whenever this idea of hers appears in her mind, there will be a powerful force to suppress it, and later, it will never appear again. In addition, when she heard the sound of carved high-heeled shoes rubbing against the floor, she always felt very excited, so that her lower body was a little wet-the existence of carved clear made her feel very comfortable. \n The iron gate was opened again, and carved fine came in. She noticed Ye Lan's eager eyes and sat in front of her with a smile, and started a new round of inquiry. Ye Lan gushed about her past experience, and carved fine nodded repeatedly, touching her head from time to time to show her approval, as if this was not an interrogation, but a conversation between friends. \n "Good boy." After the inquiry, Kering stood up and kissed Ye Lan on the cheek. "Good boy should have a reward. Stand up. " The chains that bound the night orchid were opened. She grabbed the hand that carved Qing extended to her and tried to get up, only to find that she had been fixed in a chair for a long time, and her legs couldn't work at all. She just straightened up and fell to the ground. Night orchid looked up and looked at the carved face, just like looking at the gods. Using her hands and feet, she crawled slowly to the carved one, printed a kiss full of reverence and affection on the exquisitely decorated golden tip of high heels, and licked the blood left on it. \n "Snapping" carved a ring, sat in the chair where Ye Lan had just sat, and put his foot in front of Ye Lan. "As a reward, I allow you to do what you expect." \n Ye Lan's eyes suddenly lit up, holding the carved jade foot in her hand like a child who got candy, and lowering her head, she carefully took off the high-heeled shoes like unpacking. Hold one of them with both hands, gently touch the tip of your tongue, and the touch of your toes can't help but make Kering moan. Yelan chewed the stockings, and Kering touched Yelan's forehead and said, "You are really impatient ... Ah." Yelan put her whole finger in her mouth, and her wet mouth was accompanied by itchy fingers, which made Kering groan involuntarily, and she let go playfully, and the silver wire in her mouth still stuck to the toe. Night orchid dexterous tongue in carved feet upstream, slowly moved to the ankle, but put the foot back, her bright green eyes suddenly become dim, pitiful bow their heads. \n Kering looked at Ye Lan kneeling on the ground, wanting more, and asked in a parental tone, "Ye Lan, who am I?"
