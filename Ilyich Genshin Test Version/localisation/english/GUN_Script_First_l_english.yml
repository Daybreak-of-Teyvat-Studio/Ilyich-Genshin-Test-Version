Unfortunately, when the volunteers were called, the people were reluctant to join the guard. Because they are worried about the risk of military action, or they are worried that they can't support their families. This has led to a shortage of recruits. \n Faced with recruitment difficulties, the Gounhild family had to take measures to find a solution. They turned to the aristocracy for help and paid mercenaries to join the guard. Because nobles have more resources and influence, they can provide sufficient funds and materials to support the construction and operation of the guard. Unfortunately, this led to the soldiers of the guard becoming slaves of the nobility and no longer enjoying freedom and dignity. \nAs a result, the existence of Dandelion Guard lost its original meaning and value due to the lack of extensive civilian participation and voluntary dedication. Guard soldiers lost their autonomy and became tools of aristocratic power, instead of representing the idea of protecting and serving the whole family and Mondstadt continent. "

 GUN_Event.6.d:0"The temporary military tax bill of the Goonhild family has caused a serious burden to the farmers led by Goonhild. As farmers, they bear the extra tax pressure, which makes their life more difficult. First of all, farmers need to pay higher land taxes, which greatly increases their land use costs. This is especially serious for farmers who depend on agricultural production for their livelihood, and their profits have been severely compressed. In addition, farmers also need to pay higher taxes and fees for agricultural equipment and farming tools. This makes them face a greater economic burden in purchasing and maintaining agricultural equipment, which has a direct negative impact on their planting and agricultural production activities. The implementation of the temporary military tax bill also led to an increase in the price of agricultural products. As farmers are facing increasing costs, they have to raise the price of their products to make up for the impact of taxes and fees. For people who rely on agricultural products as their main food source, this will lead to an increase in food prices and bring extra burden to their lives. "

 GUN_Event.10.d:0"The law of benefiting the people and young crops aims to reduce the burden on poor farmers and help them tide over their difficulties. However, the improper behavior of grass-roots officials in the implementation of the law has led to a series of adverse effects, one of which is that grass-roots officials force farmers to borrow money. First of all, grass-roots officials use the lending policy of the law of benefiting the people and young crops to force farmers to borrow. They forced farmers to borrow by various means, such as maliciously lowering the rating of farmland, making farmers unable to be self-sufficient, and then forcing them to turn to government loans. Grass-roots officials often set high interest rates and cumbersome repayment conditions, which make farmers fall into unbearable debts. Secondly, grass-roots officials often obtain illegal benefits by means of fraud, false report and abuse of power in the process of lending. They often fabricate farmers' debts, deliberately make farmers unable to repay loans on time, and then use this as an excuse to charge farmers high fines or forcibly occupy their property. This behavior harms the interests of farmers, increases their burden, and at the same time intensifies the contradictions and dissatisfaction between grassroots officials and farmers. In addition, the grass-roots officials forced farmers to borrow money, which also brought a series of negative consequences to the Limin Young Crop Law. Because farmers are forced to borrow and cannot repay on time, the liquidity of government loans is difficult, which leads to a vicious circle of loans. The improper behavior of grass-roots officials further increased the debt risk of the government, which gradually deviated from the original intention of the law on benefiting the people and young crops and had a negative impact on government finances. To sum up, the behavior of grass-roots officials forcing farmers to borrow money in the law of benefiting the people and young crops has brought serious adverse effects to society. This behavior harms the interests of farmers, intensifies their burdens and social contradictions, and has a negative impact on government finances. "

Some farmers even have to cut other agricultural operations or living expenses to support horses, which has seriously affected their agricultural production and livelihood stability. Due to the lack of experience and professional knowledge in raising horses, some farmers cannot raise and take care of horses correctly, which leads to an increase in the risk of illness and death of horses. Farmers can't provide suitable feed and environment, or lack veterinary knowledge and medical means, which leads to the poor health of horses under the support of farmers, or even overwhelmed and died.

 GUN_Event.14.d:0"In some cases, organizing Yong Tuan activities will have a negative impact on the political and civilian interests in Mondstadt, one of which is that landlords use Yong Tuan activities to strengthen the oppression and exploitation of farmers. Increase farmers' burden: landlords organize Yong ying activities to require farmers to participate in training, but farmers usually have already undertaken heavy agricultural labor tasks. This means that farmers need to spare time to participate in group training during busy farming hours, which increases their burden and work pressure. Oppression of labor force: landlords use group training activities to train farmers by force, and sometimes even take severe punishment measures to restrain them. This oppression of the labor force puts farmers in an unequal position and intensifies the class opposition and conflict between landlords and farmers. Deprivation of farmers' rights and interests: Some landlords further deprive farmers of their rights and interests in land and resources through group training activities. They will use group training to strengthen the control of agricultural products, land and labor, resulting in the loss of resources and economy for farmers. Safeguarding the interests of the landlord class: the landlord further consolidates his power and position through group training activities to meet his own interests, regardless of the rights and interests of farmers.

 GUN_News.32.t:0"Dissident of Dandelion League"
 GUN_News.32.d:0"A group of dissidents of unknown origin began to publicize the theories named" Kingdom of Necessity "and" Kingdom of Freedom "in the Dandelion Alliance. They claim: \n "the kingdom of necessity" is a social state in which people are dominated by materialized social relations, that is, people are dominated by things. The "kingdom of freedom" is the social relationship in which people dominate themselves, that is, the social state in which people dominate things. \n Under the condition of private ownership of means of production, people's social ties are expanding and strengthening due to the increasing socialization of production, but the private ownership of means of production makes people unable to control the social relations caused by their own activities, which in turn opposes people themselves in the form of a thing and puts people under its rule. In this social state, not only the workers are not free, but also the exploiters can't control their own destiny. Only by destroying this mode of production and abolishing the private ownership of means of production and capital can Tiwat mankind get rid of this "inevitable kingdom". This is a transition from a state in which people are governed by historical inevitability to a state in which people dominate historical inevitability, and from a state in which people are dominated by social relations to a state in which people dominate social relations. \n From the perspective of the whole society, once people have a correct understanding of the inevitability of objective society and nature and can control it, it will serve the conscious purpose of human beings, that is, when they enter the realm of freedom from the realm of necessity. In the real free kingdom, the development of human ability becomes the end itself, and people no longer succumb to any external purpose, but become the masters of themselves, which will be the hope and future of the whole Tiwat.

However, unlike the evil Lawrence family, the Gounhild family always adheres to the ancestral motto of "always protecting Mondstadt" and tries its best to protect the people of Mondstadt. In the struggle to overthrow the nobles, they stood on the side of Mondstadt people, and because of this, they avoided the fate of being expelled. Today, the Gounhild family has provided many great priests and brave knights for the Knights of the West Wind.

We decided to convene a meeting of gentry in Mondstadt and jointly put forward the following declaration in response to the situation of civil war in Mondstadt: maintaining peace and stability: we emphasize the settlement of differences in civil war in Mondstadt through peaceful negotiations and dialogue, and resolutely oppose any means of violence and force to resolve conflicts. Return to traditional values: we stick to traditional values and oppose the ideology and behavior of enlightenment and punishment. We emphasize respecting and protecting traditional culture, religion and practices in order to maintain social morality and stability. Protecting land and rights and interests: We oppose any form of land reform and resolutely safeguard land ownership and use rights. We believe that land is the rights and interests of gentry and landlords, and it is inviolable. Respect for chivalry: We oppose the reform of chivalry and firmly believe that chivalry is the core and cornerstone of Mondstadt culture. We recognize the responsibilities and obligations of knights and encourage them to protect social justice and order. Oppose the liberation of tenant farmers: We oppose the policy of liberating tenant farmers and believe that tenant farmers need the protection and guidance of gentry and landlords to ensure social order and economic stability. We call on the members of the Mondstadt gentry conference and all those who support our manifesto to work together to promote a peaceful settlement of Mondstadt civil war and build a stable, prosperous and prosperous Mondstadt with traditional culture. Please the citizens of Mondstadt actively respond to our appeal and work together to fight for the future of Mondstadt. "
