 Ilyich_Hilichurl:"Primitive denizens of the wandering wilderness of Tivat. Similar in outline to humans, but have lost their intelligence and spirituality. Recorded to have frequented the land for over a thousand years, yet without history or civilisation. Since the Black Scourge five hundred years ago, they have been widely scattered across the land. Though weak and lacking organisation, they can sometimes cause considerable trouble."
