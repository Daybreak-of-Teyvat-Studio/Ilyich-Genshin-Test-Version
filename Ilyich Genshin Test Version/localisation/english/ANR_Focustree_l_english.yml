lonely_island:0"Land of Isolation"
lonely_island_desc:0"Mondstadt fell into chaos... but it had nothing to do with Razor or the Wolvendom. The Wolvendom is sparsely populated, and all parties involved in the civil war have no interest in it, let alone the Andrius guarding here... \n But is it true that the peace here will not be disturbed?"
The_red_star_won:0"Red Star Shines Above"
The_red_star_won_desc:0"Sometimes, the tide of history can push people towards unexpected places. Bennett is just like that. A few years ago, he was just a unlucky adventurer, but today he stands in the spotlight and is elected as the leader of the Wolvendom. His resilience, approachability, and courage have conquered the people of Wolvendom, and the trust of people has made him trust himself.\n He has made up his mind to bring the people to a better future. As for where to lead the people, the new ideas known as §R\"Socialism\"§W that he has been exposed to in recent years will give him the answer."
Immernachtreich:0"Immernachtreich"
Immernachtreich_desc:0"Fischl, who has read through the eyes of countless worlds, has found a path to Immernachtreich for the confused people in this world. Standing at the end of time and space, she believed that even with the power of her own body, she could not bring her ideal vision to her subjects even if she devoted her whole life. At this moment, her loyal familiar, Ozvaldo Hrafnavins, provided her with inspiration"
partial_autonomy:0"Partial Autonomy"
partial_autonomy_desc:0"Diona has already embarked on completing her pragmatic reforms. If an institution loses its power, then something else will definitely gain it. Who would have obtained the power to voluntarily dissolve the government of Wolvendom? Diona has already made the decision"
the_same_goal_we_have:0"The Common Value"
the_same_goal_we_have_desc:0"Although the conflict between Bennett, Fischl, and Diona may seem significant, Razor keenly discovered that the three of them share a common goal: to provide a happy life for the people of the Wolvendom. He believes that maintaining this goal and partially implementing everyone's plan is a choice."
Union_of_Socialist_Republics_in_Mondstadt:0"Union of Mondstadt Socialist Republics"
Union_of_Socialist_Republics_in_Mondstadt_desc:0"Under the suggestion of Bennett, we’ve decided to found §R Union of Mondstadt Socialist Republics \(UMSR\)§W, an union of various socialist republics. There is much more to do, but a bright future is within reach."

bring_liberation_back_to_our_hometown_desc:0"After arduous battles, we people from all over Mondstadt, have finally brought peace and freedom back to the entire Mondstadt.\n All our struggles will inevitably turn into epic songs sung by minstrels, and even thousands of years later, people will still recall our heroic deeds."
establishment_of_the_pioneer_nation:0"Establish the Pioneer Nation"
establishment_of_the_pioneer_nation_desc:0"The country established by Fischl is already ahead of any regime on Teyvat. The Republic, the Federation, and the Alliance are not enough to describe the characteristics of this country. Therefore, in the initiative of artists, Prinzessin der Verurteilung decided to call it the Pioneer Nation, and a brand new name signifies a new beginning for the people of this country\n Grandeur, §R the Pioneer Nation§W!"
establishment_of_the_holy_republic_of_Mondstadt:0"Establish the Holy Republic of Mondstadt"
establishment_of_the_holy_republic_of_Mondstadt_desc:0"Diona believed that we could establish a sacred confederation under the divine power of Barbatos, and all political entities within the entire confederation would assist each other in development and war.

establishment_of_the_free_federal_of_Mondstadt_desc:0"Under Razor's proposal, a more centralized but still focused on safeguarding individual citizens' freedom’s federation will be established, named §B Free Federation of Mondstadt(FFM)§W.

In_the_Wolfendom:0"In the Wolvendom…"
In_the_Wolfendom_desc:0"There was a strange echo in the mountains of Wolvendom, and many animals were disturbed. In order to clarify what happened, Razor and the wolf pack began to investigate the situation."
Some_Strange_guys_wandering:0"…Strange guys wandering around"
Some_Strange_guys_wandering_desc:0"In the Wolvendom, Razor saw thousands of ragged human families wandering, their expressions gloomy, and their bodies generally swollen due to days of not eating. What the hell is going on here?"
connect_with_refugee:0"Contact with Refugees"
connect_with_refugee_desc:0"After careful consideration, Razor decided to take the initiative to contact the refugees that could disrupt the tranquility of the Wolvendom. And the human side sent two people to contact him\: Bennett and Fischl. These two vision owners hold a leadership position among the crowd."
expel_mankind:0"Expel Humans"
expel_mankind_desc:0"We still cannot accept these humans. Allowing them to stay may even lead to warlords outside who were originally uninterested in the Wolvendom staring at us, which is simply igniting flames."
receive_mankind:0"Accept Humans"
receive_mankind_desc:0"Although Razor grew up living among wolves, his kindness even surpassed that of many humans, making it difficult for him to drive these refugees out and allow them to continue wandering on the chaotic land of Mondstadt. So, let them stay."
deal_with_refugees_problem:0"Dealing with Refugee Issues"
deal_with_refugees_problem_desc:0"After the refugee team led by Bennett and Fischl, other refugee groups continued to settle here. Razor, Bennett, and Fischl, as the \"hosts\" of this land, approached them and made some agreements. In their subsequent communication and daily life, they identified several main problems that the refugees currently face: lack of food, lack of housing, and lack of management. Although they don't know if they can solve it, at least an action is needed."
build_housing:0"Build Housing"
build_housing_desc:0"Not to mention qualified apartments, we didn’t even have sufficient tents in Wolvendom. In such an environment, refugees not only have to endure the cold winds at night, but also the danger of being attacked by wild animals. The only way to solve this problem is to mobilize refugees to build housing for themselves. Since we have decided to take responsibility, let's take action. However, Bennett and Fischl proposed different plans for specific methods"
Bennett_simple_designation:0"Bennett\: Simple Designs"
Bennett_simple_designation_desc:0"Bennett proposed that he had seen a housing design in a magazine that was relatively good in quality and had fewer consumables to build. If we adopt this type of housing, we can solve the housing problem faster."
Fischl_revolutionary_ideas:0"Fischl\: Revolutionary Ideas"
Fischl_revolutionary_ideas_desc:0"Fischl proposed a special design that focuses on the layout of many houses rather than the composition of a single house, and can also save construction time and materials, which is called \"integrated housing\". Fischl believed that the refugees from then on \"therefore, due to the entropy of the universe and the ever-changing fate, only those who regard each other as blood relatives can survive in mutual support\"\(Oz \:\"Have to stay for a long time, such a design is conducive to the cooperation.\"\)"
primary_organization:0"Primary Organization"
primary_organization_desc:0"The current situation of the Wolvendom can be described as a completely anarchic state, and the consequences of this state have already been manifested: refugees have not been here for a few days and have started to divide their camps according to their settlements. A few days ago, two settlements even fought fiercely to seize water sources, and some settlements have even begun to use violence to seize internal belongings of others. Let's put an end to this situation, establish the most basic government based on the principle of consultation and cooperation, protect the weak and guide people to solve the problems they face together. However, what kind of government should this be?"
Fischl_thoughts_of_organization:0"Fischl\: Thoughts of Organization"
Fischl_thoughts_of_organization_desc:0"Fischl hopes to seek people from humble backgrounds with great talents and strategies, as subjects of the Prinzessin. \(Oz\: \“In various settlements, select people with lower backgrounds and higher levels of knowledge as administrative personnel and settlement representatives for negotiation and cooperation, whom are closer to the grassroots and have sufficient abilities.\”\)"
attract_external_ideologue:0"Attract External Ideologue"
attract_external_ideologue_desc:0"It is rare in modern times to see a miraculous state of anarchic self-organization transforming into government, such as the Wolvendom. Fischl will use the reputation she has accumulated from her previous novels to promote this place, trying to attract familiar thinkers. \"It is a great honor for my family to kill two birds with one stone!\" \(\"Exchange aid at the cost of allowing them to partially practice their own ideas, which can also fill the gap in our administrative staff.\"\)"
centralize_our_command:0"Centralize our Command"
centralize_our_command_desc:0"The threat we face is not only the beasts in the mountains and forests, but also the possible attacks of external warlords. Therefore, we must establish a more elite force under direct government control. Of course, this does not mean that we will ignore the settlements attacked by wild animals. After completing the training, this unit will be dispatched to various parts of the Wolvendom to guard against wild animals. This not only allows them to increase their courage in fighting against wild animals, protect the safety of refugees, but also makes our interim government more popular."
develop_our_production:0"Develop our Production"
develop_our_production_desc:0"People need to eat, and they need to eat a lot. All society should be built on this foundation, and we are not an exception. In order to provide refugees with sufficient food, we need to train them in production skills and find ways to obtain sufficient tools. The first production activities we need to prepare are hunting and gathering, which have a sufficiently short profit cycle to meet the urgent needs. As for how to train and acquire tools, we certainly have more than one solution."
Bennett_support_ourselves:0"Bennett\: Feed Ourselves"
Bennett_support_ourselves_desc:0"Bennett has been involved in the large-scale tool production activities carried out by many villages and communities. We will use our own collected materials to produce unified forms of tools, and then select experienced individuals to teach inexperienced person production methods, proving that we have the ability to support ourselves. But if we put all our energy into this, with the power of our small government, we may not have the energy to do anything else."
organize_collective_production:0"Organize Collective Production"
organize_collective_production_desc:0"Indeed, just hunting and gathering have provided us with enough food; However, we cannot always rely on these for a living. We know that wild animals and fruits will be complete consumed sooner or later, and the external disputes do not know how long they will last. In addition, our needs are not just about food, we also need clothes, paper, and even alcohol... The only way to solve these needs is to develop agricultural industry. \n Although our residents are currently living in scattered areas, our agricultural production cannot be dispersed. We must concentrate production and distribute food according to the contributions of each settlement. This can increase the income of water conservancy projects and fertilizer application, reduce the use of means of production, and save our already insufficient funds. Of course, such centralized production also brings new questions: how can we quantify the contribution in agricultural production? Many people have proposed various ideas on this issue, but which one is effective still needs to be verified in practice."
Fischl_call_for_foreign_aid:0"Fischl\: Call for Foreign Aid"
Fischl_call_for_foreign_aid_desc:0"Of course, it is necessary to produce our own tools, but every second we spend on tool making, every second our food production will be delayed a bit, and we will have to endure hunger for an extra day. So, we must allocate a portion of our energy to promote to the outside world, using stories, photos, and... to some extent, show off to raise funds, obtain tools and food assistance, and this is also for the refugees in Wolvendom."
introduction_of_advanced_tools:0"Introduct Advanced Tools"
introduction_of_advanced_tools_desc:0"In order to achieve long-term benefits and meet the needs of more people, it is necessary for us to gradually shift from primarily hunting and gathering like primitive humans to planting. However, we cannot reduce our investment in hunting and gathering now. In order to save resources as much as possible, we will introduce advanced production tool designs from the outside world."
full_up_and_warm:0"Full and Warm"
full_up_and_warm_desc:0"After brainstorming and working together, we have finally preliminarily solved the dietary issues of the refugees. Although the variety of food is not yet as diverse as what people ate before the Mondstadt Civil War, we will never see anyone starving and falling by the roadside again. Now, the residents with worried faces are also showing smiles, which is proof of our achievements."
centralize_our_government:0"Centralize our Government"
centralize_our_government_desc:0"We will establish a small team composed of several producers in the village community, and then a large team composed of multiple teams... Each person is responsible to their immediate superiors, and factories are also stacked layer by layer. Based on this, we will establish a certain type of representative democracy, which can maintain sufficient administrative efficiency while gaining public opinion, and ensure the complete implementation of the overall production and construction plan."
peoples_commune:0"People's Commune"
peoples_commune_desc:0"In the past, farmers often had nothing to do after completing agricultural production. Now, we will let some villages willing to try collectivization establish people's commune, take advantage of the productivity of farmers' leisure time, and build schools and canals everywhere, which will also improve our grass-roots control. However, in the initial period of the people's commune, the people may not adapt to this system so quickly, so we need to gradually collectivize, establish a good supervisory organization and contribution evaluation mechanism - and ensure that we always have enough surplus food to distribute to the community canteen."
large_scale_intensive_production:0"Large Scale Intensive Production"
large_scale_intensive_production_desc:0"We will set up large-scale state-owned farms directly controlled by the government in some large plain areas. In these areas, we will no longer have to worry about the problem that the fuel cost of tractors and combine harvester is higher than the income, and it is easier to implement the advanced production mode than the traditional small-scale peasant economy. The people working here are no longer farmers, but industrial workers in the fields. If we had made some relevant attempts during the government's initial establishment in the past, it may have helped improve the production efficiency of our state-owned farms."
unified_goverment_benefits:0"Unified Government Welfare"
unified_goverment_benefits_desc:0"Now that our finances are gradually becoming more abundant, it is time to provide people with security beyond food and housing. We will provide a certain amount of pension, basic income, and medical security, even if these protections are not comparable to those of powerful countries, but this is a matter of attitude. Moreover, as long as we have this framework, it is not difficult to improve welfare in the future. It is simply inevitable under our current system. We may have to worry about future government financial issues"
first_MNPC:0"The First MNPC"
first_MNPC_desc:0"Nearly a thousand representatives of the people of the region have gathered here, from all the regions with human activities in Mondstadt - from prosperous cities to peaceful forests to impoverished mountains - to cast their precious votes for Mondstadt's future. Such a conference will be held regularly without interfering with production activities, and it will become the foundation of the legitimacy of the current Bennet government, determining every critical turning point for Mondstadt. Now, let's decide on Mondstadt's future!"
sprinkle_roses_all_over_the_world:0"Sprinkle Roses all over the World"
sprinkle_roses_all_over_the_world_desc:0"In the past, when we started trying systems that no one had tried before, there were always doubts raised; Now, with a firm will, flexible means, and the wisdom of timely learning and improvement, we have overcome all difficulties, and those people have also closed their mouths. Now, we need to push this successful system to the entire Mondstadt. There will definitely be more difficulties that we have never encountered before, but as long as we maintain unity, tirelessly explore and progress, we will definitely be able to succeed."
establishment_of_the_liberated_zone_of_Mondstadt:0"Establish the Liberated Zone of Mondstadt"
establishment_of_the_liberated_zone_of_Mondstadt_desc:0"What stands on the land of Mondstadt now is no longer a traditional country, but a great community. If you want to ask how to address the current Mondstadt, it is §R\"the Liberated Zone of Mondstadt\"§W."
flat_management:0"Flat Organization Structure"
flat_management_desc:0"Some people believe that the political model of vertical structure will inevitably lead to planning errors and distorted public opinion communication. Therefore, even if it may cause damage in other aspects, we will continue the current flat organizational structure. Compared to other modes, this structure can also reduce personnel redundancy, be more flexible, and quickly adapt to changes in conditions."
all_Mondstadt_federation_of_labor_union:0"Myriads of Torches Burning"
all_Mondstadt_federation_of_labor_union_desc:0"We will construct a bottom-up planned economy, in which not only the top of the administrative structure can propose plans, but also the workers and consumers below can provide opinions to change production plans, influence personnel selection, and try new production processes. Although this constructed economic system may be relatively inefficient, it is definitely more in line with the needs of the people. The happiness of all of us will be created by all of us."
voluntary_collectivization:0"Improve our Eduction"
voluntary_collectivization_desc:0"We can all see the role of education\: it opens up a huge gap in people's minds, and all inequalities lead to educational inequality. Even if all other inequalities are erased, educational inequality will also lead to the rebirth of other inequalities. We will establish public schools and night schools for workers throughout the country, allowing producers who lack knowledge to supplement their knowledge and provide our children with more choices. At the same time, this can also meet the needs of advanced industrial production."
Subsidies_within_local_communes:0"Provide Local Communes Welfare"
Subsidies_within_local_communes_desc:0"Now that our production activities are sound, it is time to provide welfare and security for the people. However, our welfare will not be directly distributed by the central government, but will be independently formulated by local villages and communities with financial support from the central government. Of course, we will carry out a certain degree of regulation, which is also to promote democracy."
long_live_the_commune_of_wolfendom:0"Long Live the commune of Wolvendom"
long_live_the_commune_of_wolfendom_desc:0"Bennett's reform measures have declared initial success, and although there are still many problems, they will not be more difficult than the difficulties we have overcome in the past. In this small world, countless unprecedented miracles have occurred. People living in such a place are now full of courage and enthusiasm to try. What problems cannot be solved by united people? Since the dawn of success has dawned, let's put down our tools for now, wipe our sweat, and cheer together for the new name given to this land -§R The Commune of Wolvendom§W!"
establishment_of_the_socialist_commonwealth_of_Mondstadt:0"Establish the Socialist Commonwealth of Mondstadt"
establishment_of_the_socialist_commonwealth_of_Mondstadt_desc:0"After many reforms and overcoming countless difficulties, we have finally arrived here. Today, we announce the establishment of§R the Socialist Commonwealth of Mondstadt§W; \n§R Red flag waves high above! "
stop_all_the_sins:0"Verurteilung"
stop_all_the_sins_desc:0"The Prinzessin der Verurteilung has announced the expansion of the \"number of guards and crows patrolling the sky\", and she will thoroughly implement her will. Only in this way can the Wolvendom have a bright future. Although this declaration may seem suspicious, out of trust in Fischl, this action still gained the support of the people."
directed_creation:0"Industrial Production of Art"
directed_creation_desc:0"The requirement of contextualism for artistic works lies not in quality but in quantity, as well as in the fields it covers. We will interpret readers' reactions to existing art works, identify tags that readers love, and attempt to use these tags to create a large number of works ranging from novels to paintings and even jokes, which are not focused on. Other creators can also create what they want to do, but they need to be prepared to be submerged in the wave of industrial art."
judgment_to_judgment:0"\"Verurteilung\" leads Verurteilung"
judgment_to_judgment_desc:0"Our guidance on creation has shown initial results, and public opinion has shown a clear bias. As long as we can make good use of this force, we can easily change the appearance of society."
save_them_all:0"Save Them All"
save_them_all_desc:0"Some people mock our government as the /"Mommy government/" because in addition to the affairs that a normal government needs to manage, we also need to use extremely meticulous methods to manage the direction of culture, public opinion, and ideas. What we want to say is that we are not going to be verbose mothers, but to be mothers to the people, not only to educate them, but also to provide a better life for every one of them."
peoples_princess:0"Prinzessin"
peoples_princess_desc:0"Fischl claimed that \"the path to the situation is the path of eternal renewal, and to reach the Immernachtreich, every subject needs to discover the radiance of their soul\" \(Oz: \"Fischl said that she wants to use situational methods to lead everyone towards a better life, and in order to achieve that goal, it requires everyone's efforts\"\)"
bloom_together:0"Bloom together"
bloom_together_desc:0"Contextualism is not about creating a dream, it will start by breaking people's understanding of daily life, and this requires creativity - a lot of creativity, for which Fischl will introduce policies to encourage creativity. Of course, this does not mean that we just don't care what we create in the end"
Contextualism_to_Contextualism:0"\"Contextualism\" leads Contextualism"
Contextualism_to_Contextualism_desc:0"All beliefs in this world are caused by the context created by the material foundation. We need to uncover this fact and involve the people in the creation of new and advanced situations, and a future that is more democratic and equal than all democratic equality now will emerge from it.\n On this path - the path of contextualism, Fischl will lead the shaping of new situations with her popular works, accelerating the arrival of future society."
material_base:0"Material Bases"
material_base_desc:0"Some people accuse contextualism of being just a fantasy, and now we will use practical measures to refute their remarks. After the previous reform, our production and theory have made obvious progress, which enables us to increase the investment in reproduction while providing security for the residents. The mediocre often build their material foundation first, and then wait for their spiritual realm to slowly catch up, no matter how many laggards they will fall in this pursuit. And we need to make these two go hand in hand."

progress_of_the_artistic_zone_without_dawn_desc:0"The reform has been declared successful, and Wolvendom has become more progressive, avant-garde, and perfect! Walking around in any part of the Wolvendom now, you can find eye-catching works, which proves that what we have said is true. Now, even this land will become a \"landscape\", an \"art\", a tool of contextualism, named \"§R Ewige§g Nacht§W\"."
promote_and_appoint_squires:0"Promote and Appoint Squires"
promote_and_appoint_squires_desc:0"In our past construction, various villages and communities have emerged with a group of people with outstanding abilities and talents, who have relied on various means to possess more wealth than others, which is clearly proof of their abilities. If we delegate a portion of administrative power to them, we will surely be able to achieve the goal of effective governance while reducing the size of the government."
Restrain_land_annexation:0"Accelerate Land Annexation"
Restrain_land_annexation_desc:0"In the previous agricultural development, some of our farmers developed their own land and planted their own crops, forming a self-sufficient state. Now, with the authorization of the gentry, they began to acquire their land and turn them into tenant farmers. In the long run, this land merger is beneficial - the gentry will have enough property to improve their technology, even purchase agricultural machinery, build water conservancy facilities, and become massive land owners. We will establish one intensive farm after another in a completely voluntary and peaceful manner."
encourage_the_charitiess:0"Encourage the Charities"
encourage_the_charitiess_desc:0"Due to our previous measures to reduce the size of the government, we currently do not have sufficient financial and administrative resources to improve the welfare provided to residents. Therefore, we should encourage those who have benefited from previous policies and become wealthy to engage in charitable activities. As long as we promote this slightly, we believe that the public's goodwill towards us and the wealthy will also increase. Of course, in order to attract wealthy people to carry out charitable activities, these charitable organizations may innovate some other functions, but this is also a necessary measure to improve the living standards of residents."

encourage_spirit_of_enterpreneur_desc:0"Diona has decided to increase the autonomy of entrepreneurs and hand over the prosperity of the country to a free market economy, a transformation that will be completed in a very short period of time. This decision comes from a consultant named like a certain musical instrument. According to this consultant, as long as the reform is properly and thoroughly completed and everything is left to the free development of the market, problems such as unemployment, redundancy, and technological backwardness will no longer exist, and a universal market will solve all problems."
end_the_interventionism:0"End the Interventionism"
end_the_interventionism_desc:0"Market regulation is an unnecessary obstacle to the operation of the free market. This behavior may be beneficial to the economy in the short term, but in the long run it is definitely not as good as the result of the operation of the free market. The invisible hand will allocate all people and things to their rightful positions. Perhaps some people say that economic crises triggered by free markets have been common in history, but do not regulatory agencies exist in every region where economic crises erupt? Is it possible that the economic crisis is essentially caused by regulation?"
private_welfare_enterprise:0"Private Welfare Enterprise"
private_welfare_enterprise_desc:0"Isn't the pension, medical insurance, and various types of insurance operated by enterprises more trustworthy than government benefits that may be reduced at any time? Violating previous agreements will indirectly reduce the company's profits from various aspects, and in order to pursue profits, companies must instead better operate welfare funds. Such measures can also reduce government size and capital expenditure, and the saved social resources will also be concentrated in the hands of various enterprises for investment. \n The efficiency of reproduction has been greatly improved!"

Collective_enterprises_participate_in_competition_desc:0"Previously, Bennett had established many collectively owned enterprises, whose income was shared equally among all employees. However, the overly comfortable lifestyle seemed to affect their production enthusiasm, and many collective enterprises began to rely on government subsidies for survival. \n We will engage these enterprises in market competition to improve production efficiency while maintaining collective ownership."

unbreakable_union_desc:0"Our§B stitching system§W operates even better than Razor expected, and the people's choice of Razor as the leader is clearly a right choice! Now, the entire Wolvendom has become active under the guidance of a more comprehensive administrative structure, and is ready to face new challenges.

peoples_order_desc:0"A few years ago, we were just a group of refugees who were panicked and unscrupulous; Now, we have built a beautiful home and a strong army with our own hands.

Fischl_elastic_defense_desc:0"Fischl suggested that under the strong enemy attack, it is inevitable that our army will be repelled in the early stages.

andrius.1.d:0"Timmie no longer has the energy to miss his pigeons.\n After leaving Mondstadt City, he never had two meals a day. Of course, the current situation is difficult, even a child like him can see it, so he won't complain. The adults around him were enduring even more severe hunger, enduring despair and fear that he did not know. In contrast, he felt that the things he was facing were nothing. \n Sister Grace said that this was his growth. \n \”Timmie\”, Sister Grace opened her tent, \”come out and bask in the sun, don't stay inside all the time.\” \n Stepping out of the tent, Timmie saw the middle-aged men in the distance returning with food, which was a rare source of food for their vast refugee team. Although the owner of Wolvendom has not promised to let them stay, they have been allowed to gather fruits and hunt wild animals on the edge of Wolvendom. \n What will they do then? \n \”It's okay, \"Sister Grace held his hand. She was always calm, and her calmness could often infect Timmy, making him no longer afraid. \”Two owners of the vision have gone to discuss with the owner of Wolvendom. If it were them, they would definitely bring us good news. You have seen them before, remember? Brother Bennet once brought you cabbage on the bridge, and Sister Fischl once told you the story\” /n Ah, Timmie got impression. However, the impression given to him by those two people was completely different from the owner of vision mentioned in the story. The vision owners in the story, often discussed by adults, are almost always heroes with extraordinary courage and charm, leading people through one difficulty after another with extraordinary power. But Bennett and Fischl, Timmie felt that they were more like ordinary good people than heroes. \n Suddenly-- \n \“It's elemental bombing!\"a sound roared from the watchtower,\" Get down!\” \n Timmie felt a hard push coming from his back - it was Sister Grace pulling him down. \n After dazzling lights, deafening explosions, only screams, screams, and cries remained. Not figuring out what had happened, Timmie heard tears of Sister Grace after all sounds disappeared..."

The first thing he saw was not the few vision owners, but thousands of people like him who poked their heads out. At the intersection of everyone's gaze, he saw a sturdy white haired boy approaching not far away. He looked around vigilantly like a wolf, and after seeing the tragic situation at the camp, his eyes gradually turned to sympathy. \n Next to him were two acquaintances of Timmie, Bennet and Fischl, who were at some point regarded as team leaders. The three of them have been discussing something. \n As passed by Timmie, the white haired boy turned and looked at Timmie. Then he sighed and stuffed a Sunsettia into Timmie's hand, saying, \"Food... eat.\" Timmie looked at this fierce eyed young man, and for some reason, he felt a refreshing kindness from this person who couldn't even speak clearly."

Unlike me, gave up my store and came here, just picking up fruits in forest to live on......At night, I don’t even dare to get close to the forest.\” \n \”Meow~\”Prince said. When she used to open a flower shop in Mondstadt City, Flora always thought that The Cat’s Tail was just attracting people to come to the tavern by saying they can interpret cat’s language. How could a cat's meow possibly interpret so much... But now she thinks that this may be true. \n \“Don’t know what happened to  my sister......\” Flora muttered to herself unconsciously. Then she felt a cold feeling on her arm, like an ice needle sticking above. \n Flora subconsciously raised her head and saw thick black clouds... A few seconds later, the wind became stronger and rolled up Flora's skirt; The rain was also heavy, immediately wet Flora's hair. \n She hugged the cat tightly and stood up, trying to find a place to block the rain - but failed. Her tent was destroyed in the previous bombing, and there were wild beasts lurking in the forest... \n At this moment, Flora stood in the rain in a daze, holding a black cat. \n \“......Really......\”, she sighed, \"It's okay if I can't protect myself.

Although it's relatively simple, it's not a problem to shelter from the wind and rain.\" \n\"I'm glad to have a place to live, whoa~\"Flora hugged the cat and asked, \”Don't you need a final check?\"\"It's not necessary. Wagner's craftsmanship won't have any defects... \"Wagner waved his hand.\"But whatever, my previous craftsmanship was forging iron. Now let's do the construction according to the standards set by Mr. Bennet. Let's conduct a thorough inspection.\" \n ...After Wagner left, Flora closed the door, sat down on the wooden bed, and put the cat aside, took a close look at this small room. It is indeed simple, but it is already a place where people can live and can live for a long time. \n Flora looked at the cat running around the room, thinking, gaze chasing the agile black cat, she couldn't help but start thinking about how to decorate the room, even though she had no decorations at all and had no way to decorate it. Here you can put some books, and that corner you can put a pot of Cecilia flowers... by the way, flowers. After leaving Mondstadt City for so many days, she recalled her flowers for the first time. \n The flowers in Mondstadt's \"Flower Language\" store may have withered due to lack of care, right? \n Even though she has lost her flower shop, she still likes flowers very much. But it wasn't until now that she had enough time to think about her future with her flowers. She even began to contemplate possible peaceful periods in the future. When the war was over, the flower shop would reopen. At that time, there must be a cat in the shop... \n \"meow~\" \n When Flora regained consciousness, she realized that she had been sitting on a wooden bed for a long time, and there was a sound of rain outside. When did it rain? She didn't pay any attention. \n It's already late, shouldn't people outside also rest? So she looked at the only window of the small house, and to her surprise, she saw a familiar figure running along carrying wood. She called out\:"

Go beyond your limits, unleash elemental skills, and solve the difficulties in front of you! " \n\"Meow~\" said the black cat strolling leisurely on the stove. \n "Well... I'd better ask Miss Margaret. She has rich life experience.\" \n \"This is the eighth time you have bothered Miss Margaret today!\" \n \"But I must light the fire. I want to cook congee for my father.\" Ellin sighed, \”He used to boast about how powerful an adventurer he used to be, but now he's sick and can't even get out of bed... But the room is also very cold. If only there was a place to warm him up with a fire... \" \n\" Dong Dong. \" \n\" Please come in? \"Flora walked out of the kitchen and looked at the main entrance of this integrated dormitory. \n The newcomer pushed the door open and started speaking before revealing her figure. As soon as she spoke, the people in the house immediately knew who she was. \"Hmm, I feel someone is suffering from the dampness and cold...\"a sound appeared. Oz flew into the house from the crack in the door, firing thunder bullets on the waiting firewood, and immediately a flame ignited. Behind Oz, Fischl with purple dress came into the house afterward. \n\”Is that how you solve it? \" Ellin said. \n \”In the future, around 9 and 19 o'clock every day, we will come to light the kitchens and heaters of various integrated houses, and please use charcoal and firewood to maintain the fire during this period,\"Oz said. Although it is a bird, its calm voice is very reassuring. \n\”Do you want to grill it first before leaving?\"Flora noticed Fischer's long, wet hair. \n \”No, there are dozens of places left.\"Fischer turned around and said,\" Oz, let's walk away!\" \n\"Actually, I use wings to fly, Miss.\”"

I mean, are you a man? Why don't you have any backbone?\”\n\” I have already prepared my consciousness. Even if they beat me to the point where my ribs break, I will never give Miss Flora's portion of food!

Miss Flora is a lady who can become my mother!\" Ulfa stood up from the grass and said, \”Even in such an environment, she can still comfort me... but you're right, I seem to have encouraged a bit.

Ulfa thought silently and then decided to shift the topic\: \"Let's talk about what happened earlier.

But we're close enough to the vision owners, as long as we can make a loud enough noise, we can attract them, so don't be afraid,\" Irene said, \”However, if it really starts fighting, I'm afraid I won't be able to make ends meet either. I haven't had enough to eat in the past few days. \" \n Speaking of this, the sound of stomach contractions came from both of their stomachs at the same time. \n \”Me too.

But where can their refugee team have more explosives to use? \n However, he is the owner of the vision.

If facing misfortune and only being dazed, he would have died in an adventure long ago. \n At the moment when he was about to fall, he twisted his waist and swung his sword with all his might, aiming at the ground with a powerful blow - although his arm felt as if it had dislocated, this blow provided him with cushioning and allowed him to avoid falling to death when lying down on the ground. \n \”Bennett! \"\" Mr. Bennett!\"Shouted from afar. \n Bennett, lying in the middle of the stones, replied \"I'm fine!\" and skillfully pulled and fixed his dislocated arm.

Isn't it very shameful if she jumps up and ends up not being able to start this machine? \n However, things developed along the best and most unlikely path she had anticipated.

For example, the recent dispute at Camp 017. \n Local refugees have built a makeshift toilet under our organization, but this toilet obviously cannot meet the urgent physiological needs of the refugees. After having a toilet, everyone no longer wants to solve it on the spot... After the constant queues in front of the toilet for several days, someone proposed to decide the order of going to the toilet in some way. \n The first group of people proposed that the order of going to the restroom should be determined by the effort expended during the construction of the restroom, which means that those who have moved more wood and knocked more nails during the construction of the simple restroom can go to the restroom first and stay in the restroom for longer; Or further, use the total labor points of each person to determine the order of toileting; \n The second group of people believe that under the premise of the natural formation of the Mora currency system in the Wolvendom, Mora is clearly better able to demonstrate a person's overall contribution to the Wolvendom. Therefore, a toilet membership system should be established, allowing refugees to spend different amounts of Mora in advance to purchase different levels of toilet members based on their demand for toilet use. More advanced members can enjoy earlier toilet use orders longer toilet time... This proposal has another advantage, which is that it can generate income for our government. \n The third group of people believes that we should establish a toilet demand evaluation system, use this evaluation system to determine the demand level of each queuing person, and prioritize toilet use for those with higher demand. Supporters believe that this approach can better meet the demands of the masses and minimize their average time of frustration. \n Which method should we choose?"

andrius.11.d:0"After we started implementing management, many measures were implemented, from urgent measures such as obtaining drugs outside of the Ben Wolf border to actions such as opening up fields that would take some time to yield benefits, all of which began to be implemented one by one. During our actions, it is inevitable that various disputes will arise... For example, the recent incident at Camp 017. \n Local refugees have built a makeshift toilet under our organization. That night, several administrative personnel we dispatched had a need to go to the restroom at the same time, and one of them, who held the position of captain, seemed to believe that his position had brought about an improvement in his status, so he asked the other administrative personnel who arrived first to make way for him, which ultimately led to a quarrel among several people... The Mr.\"leader\" fell into a cesspit during pushing and shoving, and is now receiving treatment in the clinic. \n After learning about this matter, the thinkers who came to the Wolvendom put forward their own opinions on how to avoid such disputes from happening again and reduce the occurrence of people falling into the cesspool. \n The first school of thinkers believes that the fundamental reason for this dispute is the lack of a clear sequence of toileting, and we should establish regulations that prioritize toileting based on position. Although this may seem unequal, a clear order can indeed reduce the positive side, and make people in higher positions more capable and influential on average. Prioritizing toilet use can also help them create more benefits for society. \n The second school of thinkers believes that disputes are an inevitable part of human society. In such a dispute, the guy who falls into the pit obviously has a lack of ability. Therefore, it can be said that it is beneficial for the refugee group of the Wolvendom to eliminate him by Social Death. If we move forward, the dispute itself is beneficial, because it eliminates the guy who has insufficient ability. We should not only take measures to reduce disputes, but also encourage people to use various methods to compete for toilets. \n The third school of thinkers believed that as administrative personnel, people are not the masters of the people, but the servants of the people. In order for everyone in the Wolvendom to experience this, we should let high-ranking individuals go to the bathroom in the end - the greater their ability, the greater their responsibility. With great power there must come great responsibility."

After being attached to a cold nail in the sky above this world for over a hundred thousand years, he finally obtained a body and crawled out of the tomb with it, only to discover that his body was the founding monarch of the \"Ming Empire\" in his country. \n The protagonist, with his naive descendant Zhu Youjian, used the spirit of materialism, rationalism and progressivism to develop science and technology and organize the people, and finally led the country of the Central Plains to defeat the mutant biological invasion from the north, established a socialist country under the dictatorship of the proletariat, found the truth of the change of dynasties in the country of the Central Plains in the process of construction and development, and led the whole world to the future. \n As soon as n books were released, a large number of novel works began to imitate the storyline of \"development, war, dawn\", and similar works were called \"Farming novel\". \n Although Twilight Blade itself is widely popular, it has been criticized by some conservative artists for its entertainment."

andrius.32.d:0"Recently, a new popular novel titled Land of Battles finally went on sale, winning a positive response among the public. \n In the book, Mondstadt Citizen Kushui travels through a strange world called Steam Continent, which lacks elemental power and only has the \"water power\" that thrives to its peak. As a gifted teenager, Kushui suddenly became a useless man after creating the family's unprecedented cultivation record, and all kinds of attacks came one after another... Finally, when he was about to despair, he realized that the root of all the hardships he encountered was the deep-rooted feudalism in the world. \n So he created the martial arts Red Code, which allows everyone to practice and the more cultivators each cultivator has, the stronger their power. From then on, together with the people, he gradually moved towards the goal of overthrowing the oppression of hydraulic users. \n In this book, the protagonist often uses the technique of showing weakness to the enemy and then showing strength to defeat them. Once this book was released, this storyline began to be widely imitated. \n The author is very good at mastering the rhythm of the story and mobilizing readers' emotions, which is considered the fundamental skill of his success, but his character portrayal is slightly weak."

andrius.33.d:0"Recently, a new popular novel called Mother of Monsters finally went on sale, winning widespread positive reactions among the public. \n The initial inspiration for this book came from the legend of Inazuma's worship of gods, and later borrowed some knowledge from Fontaine. \n The story takes place in a world similar to but different from the reign of the old nobles of Mondstadt. As the protagonist, Normandy, travels through it, she discovers that her former owner has just completed the feat of hanging herself. As the story progressed, she found herself able to enter a mysterious space called the Final Palace and communicate with people thousands of miles away. Therefore, she began to use half deception and half cooperation to gain benefits and ensure her own survival in this place. \n After experiencing a series of difficulties, Normandy gradually became entangled with more and more people, and became true friends and companions with the people in the final palace who were deceived by her. In the end, after discovering all the truth, in order to protect these friends, Normandy defeated one enemy after another. After defeating the powerful and cunning enemy \"La\" that runs through the second half of the work, she became a transcendent existence above the gods, but had to fall into a deep sleep as a result. \n The plot of this book is full of ups and downs, and the character portrayal is full and moving. Even the details of the basic setting of bread prices are very real, making it an excellent work that even conservative artists have to praise. Its only drawback is that this work is a trilogy, and the author plans to write a second one in two years. In other words, we won't be able to see Mother of Monsters 2 until March of the following year."

andrius.34.d:0"Recently, a new popular novel called The Flower King finally went on sale, winning widespread positive reactions among connoisseurs. \n This book tells the story of Wolvendom's natural transformation project in the past. In the book, as refugees, the reclamation team was discouraged by old farmers while reclaiming farmland - not to pick the largest sweet-flower, as picking it would bring disaster. However, the reclamation team disregarded persuasion and went their own way, pulling out the sweet flowers. In the end, they were retaliated by nature, and the entire team left in a state of despair. The old farmer, looking at the destroyed nature, left a letter and died. \n This book has received widespread praise from the gentry, who believe that it appropriately reflects on the absurd policies of the past Wolvendom. The \"Sweet-Flower King\" in the book represents Mondstadt's unbreakable tradition, and the core idea of the book is that those who break the tradition will be punished."

andrius.35.d:0"Recently, an entertainment film \"Cyber Era\" was released and received a lot of negative reviews from critics. \n In the movie, David Martinez, a worker, works in a factory until he becomes mentally ill. When he sees a quadrilateral object, he cannot help but use a wrench to twist it and then becomes an experimental object of the \"water dispenser\" introduced by the factory director... In the end, David loses his job and decides to go to prison in order to obtain food and water after losing his job. In the process of attempting to be imprisoned, he saved a woman named Lucy who was stealing sweet flower brewed chicken belly. After experiencing a winding and funny \"adventure\", the two eventually fell in love and lived together through this \"cyber era\". \n The connoisseurs unanimously believe that this film excessively exaggerates the difficulties faced by workers and is suspected of maliciously vilifying the image of entrepreneurs. In addition, due to the reflection of some current political issues in the Wolvendom in this work, a behavior investigation company jointly established by many companies accused the protagonist Chaplin of being a red element caused by one of the seven stars, Keqing. However, Chaplin firmly denied this and attempted to leave Wolvendom, but he ultimately failed. \n It is said that the ending of the film was not originally a happy reunion, but rather David committed suicide at the top of the Wolvendom to maintain his final subjectivity, expressing his unwillingness to obey the existing order. At the same time, it should also be mentioned in the play that \"in the Wolvendom, the dead are true legends\"."

The bystanders and murder weapon in the case clearly indicate that this is a false accusation case, and the judge also believes this and decides to acquit the person. At this time, Wolvendom passed a new judicial reform and passed the \"jury\" system. The 12 beautiful girls serving as the jury in this case need to discuss the case in the jury lounge before the case is closed, and the discussion results must be unanimously approved before the case can be officially closed. When eleven of the beautiful girls hoped to find the boy innocent, only the last girl persisted in discussing the case and ultimately discovered that the suspect was actually the real criminal. Finally, through various conflicts of different outlooks on life and debates over different ways of thinking, all jurors responsibly cast their sacred vote. Finally, all 12 jurors reached a consensus\: He is guilty! \n A major feature of this film is its extremely rich scenes, which are overwhelming. Moreover, many actors have performed brilliantly, creating a story that delves into the pros and cons of the jury system with strong drama and appeal. \n After the release of this film, the surroundings of the twelve beautiful girls in the drama also began to sell. Currently, the most widely sold one is the \"ultimate villain\" of the entire drama - a white-haired, red-eyed, and equal sized big pillow. It is said that someone is already creating a fan novel about her and the female protagonist."

Just like in the old city of Mondstadt, little Miss Flora stood in her bunk, surrounded by a circle of blooming flowers. When seeing this scene, the reporter couldn't help but recall the prosperous and peaceful scene of the city of Mondstadt before the Mondstadt Civil War. \n When interviewed, Miss Flora happily and loudly told the reporter, \"After living in the Wolvendom for a period of time, I found that everyone has gradually overcome hunger, and many people have started to pursue other things, such as decorating their own houses... Therefore, I reopened this store, hoping to help everyone. And I was able to reopen Language of Flowers thanks to everyone's support, Miss Flora was one of the first immigrants to come to Wolvendom and worked in a textile factory for a long time. After working for a long time and saving a lot of money, after careful consideration, she borrowed money from several friends, and finally had the new Language of Flowers we see now.\” \n The new \"Language of Flowers\" has a thriving customer base, even more popular than in the past when it was in Mondstadt City. Miss Ellin, the militia captain who temporarily helped in the store, told our reporter during her break from work\: \"I was originally worried that this store would be difficult to make a profit, but now with so many people coming, it's really exhausting for me.\" \n The success of the new \"Language of Flowers\" indicates that the people of the Wolvendom now have enough purchasing power to obtain luxury goods. It is undoubtedly a miracle created by our joint construction in the past that we have gone from being hungry to this point in just a few years. \n A passing fishing worker who did not want to be named said that he was very moved by this, almost to the point where tears were streaming down his eyes."

andrius.1003.d:0"In our administrative structure, we have gradually broken away from the state of being \"as thin as a stick\" and begun to gradually fill in flesh and blood. Now, we have finally established the first court, which is located in a wooden house, with an ordinary and unremarkable interior. At first glance, outsiders may think that so many chairs must be a restaurant. \n Now, this court has begun to operate, making our trial process smoother and more legitimate \(some thinkers still need to discuss what is' legitimate '\), and also allowing many civil disputes to be coordinated by us. However, there are also new problems arising from it\: our judicial system lacks a \"guiding ideology\", and sometimes there are dilemmas in certain matters, such as the recent incident, which requires you to make decisions\: \n This matter is still related to the toilet, please do not eat yet... Is it possible that in this lifetime, people simply go from one toilet to another? To put it bluntly, some village communities have recently discovered that there are some strange buckets in the urinals of their public toilets, with labels attached, stating that urine collection will be centralized and processed in response to the central government's call, but we have never done such a strange thing. After investigation, we found that there was a group of people collecting people's urine by this deceptive means, and the use was very broad - for example, it was sold to superstitious old people to exorcise demons, and some substances were extracted from it for alchemy. These people have all been arrested, and as for the stolen goods, everyone is not very willing to go and \"capture\" them. \n This fact can be large or small, and at a higher level, it can be judged as fraud or theft of \"property\"; At a young age, just criticize and educate. But how to actually do it involves a conceptual dispute. Should our judicial punishment be aimed at \"punishing criminals to deter\" or guided by \"curing criminals as normal\"? \n The former believes that reasonable punishment is of course the most effective means to prevent crime, and undoubtedly conforms to people's natural view of justice\: good people should have sugar to eat, and bad people should be punished. Since these people have violated the law, we must punish them and make them abandon this \"idea of getting rich\" and use this creativity and energy that has nowhere to vent - they can even do this, why can't they make money? \n The latter believes that such behavior is ultimately caused by society\: our laws are not yet widely disseminated to the people, and they are making money by taking such measures. Isn't this not caused by our government's inadequate efforts? They actually have a market for selling these things, isn't it because we don't have enough basic education for the people? We should re educate them, provide \"treatment\" to these minor offenders, eliminate their willingness to \"steal property\" again, and be able to return to society normally. \n What is our choice?"

andrius.1004.d:0"After the Mondstadt Civil War began, it became difficult for children to even have enough food and a future, let alone continue their education and achieve promised futures. As a result, for a long time, the children who came to our Wolvendom did not have schools to attend and were often utilized as important labor due to our lack of resources. Sometimes they even worked in dangerous positions. Now, we have finally established our first school - an open-air one. Children of all ages sit on small wooden boxes, using larger ones as desks, while listening to the teacher's lessons.\n Of course, this is just the beginning, as one school cannot accept all the children in Wolvendom. We will eventually fill this place with schools, so that the children can master enough skills for satisfying futures after the civil war. Illiterate individuals can also go to Evening classes for adults to improve their skills and achieve a better life. \n However, before that, we have something to decide, which have nothing to do with toilets finally\: what kind of education policy should we adopt? This may not directly change our current situation but will undoubtedly have far-reaching effects.\n Firstly, some people believe that we should adopt a \“Class Separation\” system. The children of the same grade but different levels of knowledge are divided into different classes, judged by their \“knowledge level\” and \“Adapting\” to their individual paces. In this way, we can cultivate talents at different levels with fewer resources. However, skeptics argue that as long as the policy is published, it will create an enormous gap between classes, allowing \“fast-class\” students to receive the best education while \“slow-class\” students are abandoned. Moreover, at that time, who gets into the \“fast-class\” is not just determined by academic performance. \n Apart from that, another idea that some also support is achieving equitable education as possible as we can, without considering of children's background and intelligence, changed the devotion of educational resources. By doing this, we can achieve fair competition, in which case we can truly excellent talents for society instead of the children of haves who are only knowledgeable due to the forced injection of massive educational resources. This undoubtedly embodies the spirit of egalitarianism. But skeptics believe that there are undoubtedly differences in people's intelligence, perseverance, and cognitive abilities, even if these differences were not significant at birth, they will inevitably widen as they grow up and start attending schools. This approach is undoubtedly a waste of social resources.\n Our choice is\:"

This art form requires a greater number of readers and a profit from printing and sales compared to previous art, emphasizing the use of separated lenses that can create a \"coherent\" illusion for the audience to express the story, and placing more emphasis on expressiveness rather than details than illustrations. \n Among the recent comics that have emerged, the most popular one is... Miss Fischl’s self created \"The Classroom Save\" outside of work hours, which seems to combine her own experiences in the field of education. \n This work tells the story of a gentle man named \"Save Sensei\" who, in a strange world known as the \"Steam Planet,\" the \"greatest physician in history,\" repaired the moon destroyed by humans by 70% and fell seriously ill. For unknown reasons, he served as the least valued 2-year G class teacher at the extremely elite education institution \"Heaven Middle School\". The leaders of various countries are concerned that this great man may need first aid at any time due to a serious illness, so they are delivering professional medical equipment to the students in Class G, hoping that they can save his life at a critical moment... Against this backdrop, the story between the happy teacher and the students has begun. \n This story is considered to have strong practical significance on the basis of its strong entertainment, and its title \"Saving the Classroom\" clearly has a certain profound meaning.

Now they have to move to outdoor classes because the scheduled classroom can no longer accommodate everyone. So they came to the lawn of the newly built People's Park to teach musical instruments, and the melodious music could be heard from a distance.

At this time, we need a holiday to celebrate our peaceful residence and showcase the achievements of our labor. \n In our relatively poor place, people cannot put on lanterns and decorations like in the past in Mondstadt City, nor do they have enough Wind Glider for people to use, but they have also found new ways to celebrate. Everyone makes simple musical instruments out of wood, plays music and sings on the streets, crushes various fruits into paint, and adds simple and wild decorations to their houses and faces, creating a joyful atmosphere no less than in the past. Obviously, the festive atmosphere of a festival does not necessarily depend on the scale of the celebration, and the smile on people's faces is the best way to celebrate. \n Although today is a holiday, there are particularly many people joining the hunter team to hunt. This is not only a traditional \"bow and arrow challenge\" in a \"new\" way, but also a custom in some places to catch foxes and then put them on wreaths to pray for love. If you go to the surrounding woods now, you will find that every fox you see has a wreath on its head. \n People's celebration is not only an expectation for a better future, but also a farewell to the sorrowful past.

In the past, this challenge commemorated the history of exploration and hunting at the beginning of Mondstadt's establishment; Now, it has added a new meaning\: commemorating our time when we arrived at the Wolvendom, rebuilding our homes, and building a better life.

Although some people believe that this is restricting the freedom of wild animals, the wolves clearly do not think so. \n Just like last year, we held a memorial service to the victims of the civil war, but this time it was organized by the central government. Amidst the floating dandelions and the swirling windmills, people's sadness gradually turned into anger. A new perspective has spread in Wolvendom\: Except for us, all other forces in the civil war are just hateful executioners. No matter which one of them wins the world, Mondstadt will not usher in a better future, and we must fight for it ourselves. \n Nowadays, the people of the Wolf Run no longer see themselves as deserters.

However, many wealthy individuals still purchased a large amount of Plaustrites from Liyue, hired a large number of workers to build relatively small Ming Xiao Lanterns, and made their own designs.

The people finally have the freedom to walk freely on the land of their motherland and the freedom to regain a happy life with both hands. \n Today, we are heartened by the brave soldiers, applauded by the hardworking producers, rejoiced in our future, and mourned for our lost compatriots. A few years ago, that group of detestable traitors launched a war and betrayed the people of Mondstadt. We were forced to leave our homes and go to the rarely visited area of the Wolvendom to rebuild our homes. At that time, no force had ever taken us seriously. They saw us as trouble, kicking us around like a ball. If it weren't for Mr. Razor's sympathy and willingness to keep us, perhaps we would have become part of the unknown victims of war. \n Now, we have rushed out of the Wolvendom, and our soldiers have trampled every corner of Mondstadt. Our flag is flying at the highest point of Mondstadt, and the people who once made us feel pain are now crawling at our feet. We have used force to bring peace, freedom, and dignity! We also need to hand over this peace, freedom, and dignity to every one of our compatriots! \n We have become legends, and people call our victory a miracle. Our story will be recorded in history, becoming a mythological legend passed down in people's mouths like Vennessa, and will still be passed down by noble people thousands of years later! \n Our goal is not to bomb out a 'new order', but to bring back precious peace and freedom for Mondstadt. Now, this goal has not been fully achieved, and we have not even touched the beginning of its realization. To achieve this goal, we will implement our will throughout Mondstadt. Let those who oppose us continue to clamor, we will still gallop on the path to a better life!"

This hero is not a soldier on the battlefield, but an ordinary fishing worker in the rear; It is not a person of noble birth, nor even a performer, but one of us ordinary people. He is Urfa, a recognized model worker. \n In fact, I never swam before coming to the Wolvendom, "Urfa told reporters, At that time, I was pondering how to build a boat by the edge of the Cinder Lake, but every time it sank to the bottom. After arriving at the Wolvendom, other enthusiastic fishermen taught me how to design boats and catch lake fish, which gave me the ability to work at the Cinder Lake. Later, I continuously improved my skills in my work, encouraged and shared knowledge with my colleagues, and ultimately received such an honor, I often receive the honor of being the top fishing leader in the fishing industry. When others asked him the secret to salvaging so many aquatic products, he did not hesitate to share his knowledge with others and told his colleagues, \"Only knowledge is not enough. Make up your mind first, and then keep working hard, which is the only way to succeed.\" In addition to working hard, his colleagues also praised Urfa as a kind and brave person. One day, while working at Cinder Lake, Urfa noticed that Miss Flora, whom he had never met before, had slipped and fallen into the water. Without hesitation, he jumped into the water and rescued Miss Flora from the shore. \n \”Mr. Urfa has always been very active, \"said Miss Flora afterwards. \n \”At that time, everyone would want to take action to save people. But what can be protected by heart alone! \"Mr. Urfa said," You cannot escape, you need to take action to achieve results. Why not do what you want to do, what you can do, what you need to do.\” \n Urfa has made extraordinary achievements in ordinary positions and composed a magnificent song of laborers in our construction.

andrius.1036.d:0"......We're back. We, the people of Mondstadt, have defeated all reactionary enemies and regained the power that originally belonged to us. \n As the leader of our struggle, Ms. Diona, although deceived by our enemies, led us to defeat the new enemies born among us and bring freedom back to the people of Mondstadt. \n Freedom... Mondstadt's history is the process of moving from lower level freedom to higher level freedom. Now, we have taken it to the next level. Just like when the nobles seized power after the fall of the Decarabian, and Vennessa defeated the old nobles. \n At the beginning, when we first arrived at the Wolvendom, we felt that the only difficulties we faced were building housing, preparing food, and organizing a government. After overcoming these difficulties, it was a smooth road; Later on, we discovered that we had to face difficulties in protecting ourselves and further developing; Later on, there were difficulties in defeating warlords and unifying Mondstadt... We have now overcome a new obstacle, but in the future, there will definitely be more obstacles emerging from unexpected places to trouble us. \n However, as we see now, those obstacles will only become stepping stones for us. Adversities only make us stronger and greater than countries that have not experienced them. \n Our great People's Republic of Mondstadt will surely climb step by step, stepping on those stepping stones, to reach peaks that others cannot reach, and witness beautiful scenery that others cannot see."

Countless people have provided us with suggestions that they consider reasonable, and this is one of them: perhaps we can privatize a portion of civil industries, such as the textile industry, and reduce the burden on our administrative agencies to allocate social resources through limited market competition. This proposal has sparked widespread discussion in Mondstadt today, with as many people believing that it can have a positive effect as many believing that this change will only bring negative consequences. \n How should we approach this wave of public opinion?"

andrius.1038.d:0"In our attempts to build Mondstadt, we have faced countless disagreements. Countless people have given us suggestions that they consider reasonable, and this is one of them: to fully nationalize some industries, so that they can be directly controlled by the government, so that we can control the national lifeline, accelerate infrastructure construction, intervene in the economy to promote employment, and so on. \n This suggestion is certainly reasonable, but the question is to what extent our nationalization should proceed. Some people believe that excessive nationalization is harmful interference in the free market and can also bring unnecessary financial burden to our government."

Now she has an extremely strong consulting team, and their profound knowledge will be used to assist Diona's leadership. \n For a period of time, she was a supporter of the Bennett line, but after careful consideration, she was worried that Bennett's policies were too radical and difficult for people to accept... So she came here as a predetermined \"second line\" to lead the people of this side towards a beautiful future through negotiation. \n The most difficult level has been passed, Diona thought, keep moving forward! \n But what she didn't see was the snickering of everyone in the shadow below as she turned back"

andrius.1040.d:0"Some new problems have appeared on our path forward: we have tried to implement democratic management in factories, with cadres’ managers in labor and workers participating in management, reforming unreasonable rules and regulations, and allowing workers, leadership, and technical personnel to better link to the operation of industries. Many factories have flourished like never before, with rapidly increasing production and quality, and new technologies emerging from these factories. Every day, people raise new useful suggestions based on the work ---- but various problems have appeared in many more factories: Some workers in certain factories have abandoned their democratic rights and unconditionally trust a certain leader, effectively forming a kind of patriarchal system;\n Some factories began to isolate outsiders internally and required anyone who wanted to purchase from the factory to send gifts to each worker. These workers were given the title of \"worker aristocracy\";\n Some factories formed small groups and reduced profits to the level that they could give the entire factory welfare and complete basic targets to reduce production tasks on purpose...\n How should we solve these problems?

andrius.1041.d:0"New obstacles seem to have appeared on our path towards a better life: the obesity rates. In the process of rebuilding Mondstadt, our grain output has continued to set new highs, and the grain consumed by our people has also reached new heights. The next statistic that will reach new highs is Mondstadt's obesity rate.\n Obesity can lead to many chronic diseases, damaging the overall health of our residents. If it is a fatal disease, perhaps elemental magic can be used to treat it; for some well-known stubborn diseases, alchemists may have methods to treat it. However, there is simply no special medicine to cure diabetes in Teyvat.\n Of course, obesity means that our residents' malnutrition rates have decreased, and it can be foreseen that in the case of sufficient grain supply, our next generation will certainly be smarter and taller, which is barely good news.\n What measures should we take to deal with this situation?"

andrius.1042.d:0"An outstanding success has emerged on our path to a better life, at least according to the newspapers: according to statistics, the average obesity rate of our people has dropped. This is clearly because more employment opportunities have been provided in the process of rebuilding Mondstadt, and more and more idle people have participated in actual production, enabling them to shed excess fat.\n The benefits of reducing obesity are obvious: it not only fits current aesthetics but also reduces the probability of many chronic diseases. Moreover, a group of capable workers are obviously more suitable for work than a group of overweight people."

As many people in our army were former Mondstadt residents, our occupation did not provoke much resistance.\n Compared with other forces that have fought against us, the Knights of Favonius seemed less "heinous," but their performance shows that they are no longer capable of being the legitimate government of Mondstadt to safeguard the safety and freedom of Mondstadt's people. Therefore, those who are capable will replace them. Moreover, is there a military government that can last for hundreds of years?\n If our victory over the Gunnhildr Clan demonstrated our strength to conquer the world, then occupying Mondstadt city will silence the warlords who still exist—or remaining now-- within Mondstadt (if they still exist). If we can penetrate the ridiculous reactionary Lawrence clan within Mondstadt that attacked for several years, then who in Mondstadt can stop us?\n Our strength comes from the people's strong desire for peace and freedom, driving us like an unstoppable tide.

The ordinary staff in the estate have now been released, while some officials and generals have been arrested and waiting for our handling. The owner of the estate has left with his army, and obviously our occupation of Dawn Winery does not mean we have won this war - but it is definitely a major victory. \n At the beginning of our declaration of war against Gunnhildr, the entire Mondstadt was waiting to see our jokes. But now, those who used to despise us will be amazed by our strength and courage. Our occupation dealt a heavy blow to the powerful force that has been surrounding us, telling the world that we are a pack of wolves rather than a timid dog. Now, these wolves have rushed out of the Wolvendom and are about to head towards the entire Mondstadt."

Then, under the gaze of the residents here, our team held a military parade under the large and magnificent castle, declaring a major victory in the \"Mondstadt Liberation War\", and then blew up the ridiculous castle. \n Our journalist wrote, \"This castle was not built on so-called glory. Its original owner was a complete traitor, and all its beauty and grandeur were built on the suffering of the Mondstadt people - our loved ones and friends who died in the Mondstadt Civil War were its foundation. That's why we destroyed it.\" \n The collapse of this castle was like playing chess, We used chess pieces to knock down the opponent's king. Now, how long can these reactionary executioners continue to support? This duration will be recorded in history. If it is short enough, it may even become a famous historical joke. \n This victory, as well as all previous victories, is a demonstration of our strength, wisdom, and courage to the world.

Although this young man cannot even speak fluently, as the owner of the vision, the apex of the local wildlife food chain, and the most easily accessible object for external humans, he is the natural 'government' here. This 'natural government' also relies on hunting for a living and has relatively few connections with the outside world. \n For many years, Wolvendom has been in a state of peace and tranquility, after all, the only disputes that can occur here are only battles on the food chain, and Mondstadt has always been peaceful. Even if war breaks out, no one is interested in this place where there are no people or Mora. \n However, if you have the vision to penetrate the opportunity... perhaps you can see that the curtain of fate has already been lifted. Can Mondstadt really continue to maintain peace in the upcoming great drama? If Mondstadt falls into the flames of war, can the Wolvendim continue to be neutral? \n ... perhaps, the peaceful time that many creatures in the Wolvendom have been able to enjoy has not been long. \n On the stage of fate, it is not necessarily Razor who will lead.

At the end of the game, players are faced with the divergence of ways to save all parallel worlds\: cooperate with Heaven to implement the \"Mung Been Cake Plan\"; Or collaborate with the Demon Realm to implement the \"Waifu Cake Plan\"; Or... after witnessing the end of two paths, accept the help of the ultimate weapon girl from the future, \"Laplace's Cat\", and embark on the path we did not have the opportunity to choose. \n The game has received widespread praise, and the production team claims that the production of 'Monster Girl Quest! 2' is also planned."
