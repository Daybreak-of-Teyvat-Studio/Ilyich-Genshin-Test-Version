When volunteers were called up, unfortunately, civilians were reluctant to join the guards. Because they are worried about the risks of military action, or about not being able to support their families. This has led to a shortage of recruits. Faced with recruitment difficulties, the Gunnhilds had to take steps to find a solution. They turned to the aristocracy for help and paid mercenaries to join the guards. Since the nobles had more resources and influence, they were able to provide sufficient funds and supplies to support the construction and operation of the Guard. Unfortunately, this resulted in the Guards becoming slaves to the nobility and no longer enjoying freedom and dignity. As a result, the presence of the Dandelion Guard lost its original meaning and value due to the lack of broad civilian participation and voluntary dedication. The Guards lost their autonomy and became instruments of aristocratic power, rather than representing the idea of protecting and serving the entire family and the continent of Mondstadt."

As farmers, they are subjected to additional tax pressures that make their lives more difficult. First, farmers need to pay higher land taxes, which makes their land use costs significantly higher. This is particularly severe for farmers who depend on agricultural production for their livelihood, and their profits have been severely compressed. In addition, farmers have to pay higher taxes on farm equipment and tools. This makes them face a greater financial burden in purchasing and maintaining agricultural equipment, which has a direct negative impact on their planting and agricultural production activities. The temporary military tax Act also led to an increase in agricultural prices. As farmers face increased costs, they have to raise the price of their products to compensate for the tax. This leads to higher food prices and an additional burden for people who depend on agricultural products as their main source of food."

Despite the efforts and courage of the hunting army, they were unable to win in the face of the mighty power and resourcefulness of the Wind Demon Dragon. The Wind Demon Dragon uses its powerful attack capabilities and defense mechanisms to put the hunting army in a difficult position, resulting in its inability to effectively counter the dragon's power. The results have had consequences for Gunnhildt and the community as a whole. The angry Wind Dragon destroyed three villages west of Gunhild. The failure of the hunting army threatened the security of Gunhild Territory and affected the lives of its inhabitants. It also underscores the severity of the Wind Demon Dragon's power and threat, which requires the combined efforts of the entire community to effectively combat it. Despite the defeat of the Hunting Army in this confrontation, the outcome serves as a reminder to the community and the army to be alert to the threat of the Wind Demon Dragon and to seek a more comprehensive and powerful strategy against this formidable enemy.

The Jingfu Port expansion project also contributes to the development of navigation and maritime trade in the background. Improved navigation conditions and increased access to and from the port attracted more merchants and ships to visit the port, driving the growth of maritime trade and strengthening the port's links with other regions. The Jingfu Port expansion project has provided more employment opportunities for the community. The implementation of the project requires a large labor force, including construction workers, dockworkers and professionals in related fields. This not only provides a livelihood for local residents, but also attracts more people to the surrounding area, driving population growth and the prosperity of the city. The result of the Jingfu Port expansion project will help to improve the development level of the city.

GUN_Event.10.d:0"Limin Green Seedling Law aims to reduce the burden of poor farmers and help them tide over difficulties. However, in the process of implementing the law, due to the improper behavior of the grassroots officials, a series of bad effects were caused, one of which was that the grassroots officials forced farmers to borrow money. First, officials at the grassroots took advantage of the lending policy of the Law and used it to force farmers to borrow. They force farmers to borrow in a variety of ways, such as malicious downgrading of farmland, making farmers unable to support themselves and forcing them to resort to government loans. Officials at the grass-roots level often set high interest rates and cumbersome repayment conditions, making farmers trapped in unbearable debts. Secondly, grassroots officials often obtain illegal benefits by means of fraud, false declaration and abuse of power in the process of lending. They often fabricate farmers' debts, deliberately making them unable to repay loans on time, and then use this as an excuse to charge farmers high fines or forcibly seize their property. This kind of behavior harms the interests of farmers, increases their burden, and intensifies the contradictions and discontent between grassroots officials and farmers. In addition, the law of forcing farmers to borrow money to benefit the people's green crops has brought a series of negative consequences. As farmers are forced to borrow and fail to repay on time, the liquidity of government loans has suffered, leading to a vicious cycle of lending. The misbehavior of the grassroots officials further increases the debt risk of the government, makes the original intention of the law deviate gradually, and has a negative impact on the government finance. To sum up, the behavior of grassroots officials forcing farmers to borrow money in the law has brought serious adverse effects on society. Such behavior harms farmers' interests, aggravates their burden and social conflicts, and has a negative impact on government finances."

Due to a lack of equine experience and expertise, some farmers are unable to properly raise and care for their horses, leading to an increased risk of illness and death. Farmers' inability to provide suitable feed and environment, or lack of veterinary knowledge and medical treatment, resulted in poor health and even death of horses under farmer's provisions.

This means that farmers need to set aside time to participate in group training when farming is busy, increasing their burden and work pressure. Oppression of labor force: landlords used group training activities to train peasants by force, and sometimes even took severe punitive measures to restrain them. This act of oppressing the labor force puts the peasants in an unequal position and intensifies the class antagonism and conflict between landlords and peasants. Depriving farmers of their rights and interests: Some landlords further deprive farmers of their rights and interests in land and resources through group training activities. They will use group training to strengthen their control over agricultural production, land and labor, resulting in the loss of resources and the economy of farmers. Safeguarding the interests of the landlord class: landlords further consolidate their power and status through group training activities to meet their own interests, regardless of the rights and interests of farmers.

In the struggle to overthrow the nobility, they sided with the people of Mondstadte, and because of this, they avoided being expelled.

We decided to convene a meeting of the Mondstadte Gentry and jointly put forward the following declaration in response to the situation of the Mondstadte Civil War: Maintaining peace and stability: We emphasize the settlement of differences in the Mondstadte Civil War through peaceful negotiations and dialogue, and firmly oppose any violent and armed solution to the conflict. Return to traditional values: We adhere to traditional values and oppose the ideology and behavior of enlightenment and punishment. We emphasize respect for and protection of traditional cultures, religions and practices in order to maintain the morality and stability of society. Protecting land and rights: We oppose any form of land reform and resolutely safeguard land ownership and use rights. We believe that land is the rights and interests of gentry and landowners and is inviolable. Respect for knighthood: We oppose the reform of knighthood and firmly believe that knighthood is the core and cornerstone of Mondstadte culture. We recognize the duties and obligations of knights and encourage them to protect the justice and order of society. Opposing the emancipation of the sharecroppers: We opposed the policy of the emancipation of the sharecroppers, believing that the sharecroppers needed the protection and guidance of the gentry and landowners to ensure social order and economic stability. We call on the members of the Mondstadte Gentry Council and all those who support our declaration to work together to promote a peaceful solution to the Mondstadte civil war and to create a stable, prosperous Mondstadte where traditional culture flourishes. We ask the citizens of Mondstadte to respond positively to our appeal and work together for the future of Mondstadte."
