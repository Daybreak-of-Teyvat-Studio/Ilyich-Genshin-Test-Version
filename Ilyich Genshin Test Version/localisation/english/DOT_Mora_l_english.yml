moneymod.11.d:0 "[LYY.GetFlag] Chief Economic Advisor of Liyue Tianquan Ningguang Reply: \n\nThe fiscal revenue of a country is linked to the number of civilian factories in a country, and is affected by the national basic income, the country's trade and import conditions, the number of military factories on land and sea, and the number of army units on land and sea.\n\n In the case of Liyue, the basic tax of the state is 5 million mora, an average civilian factory can provide 1 million Mora, maintaining a military factory costs 400,000 Mora, maintaining a naval dock costs 200,000 Mora, and maintaining a battalion of troops costs 500,000 Mora.\n\n Daily Fiscal Revenue = National Basic Income + Taxes on Civil Factories + Trade and Export Revenue. \n Daily Expenditure = Expenditure on Military Maintenance + Expenditure on Military plants + Expenditure on Naval Docks + Expenditure on Trade Imports \n\nCurrent Fiscal Situation \n National Stockpile: §G[?

 #\nTianquan Ningguang, the chief economist of Liyue, suggested that a country's tax revenue is linked to the number of civilian factories in the country, and only when the civilian factories in the country are idle will they produce civilian factory revenue. In the case of Liyue, an average civilian factory provides 1 million Moras in tax revenue, and an additional 1 million Moras in state revenue if the civilian factory is idle. At the same time, a country's trade import and export situation and the number of navy, army and air force will also seriously affect the country's financial situation. May Teyvat enjoy peace and prosperity.
