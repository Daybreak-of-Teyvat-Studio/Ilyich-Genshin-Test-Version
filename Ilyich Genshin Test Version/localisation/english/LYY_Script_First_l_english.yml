In this regard, Tianquan Coagguang tried to organize a new government including the flying Cloud Chamber of Commerce, Black Rock Factory, Southern Cross fleet and other forces to ease the crisis. In the face of the threat of General Shigeyun, Riyue Port workers and soldiers representative Committee and light Cezhuang farmers Association chose to compromise. In the end, Riyuki Port formed a temporary five-member ruling cabinet, consisting of four former Seven Stars and one Riyuki People's Representative, headed by the Tenkwon Jingguang, to temporarily exercise power until the issue was resolved.

The provisional government's plan to abandon its plans for Bisuwon aroused a violent opposition from the people like a hurricane. When Tianquan Ningguang publicly denied that the government had ever had any such intention, he was met with a burst of laughter from the people. "Cornered by the pressure of the revolution, the provisional government, in order to escape, told a huge lie, guaranteeing that it had never thought of escaping Riwol port and that it was unwilling to give up Bisuwon," cried the Riwol People's Voice newspaper.

It was a cold, overcast day. The gate of the National Bank was closed tightly, and several Qianyan Army guards stood at the gate, holding half-worn white tassel-tops in their hands. "To which side do you belong?" I asked. "Does it belong to the provisional government?" "The provisional government is finished," replied one of the guards with a smile. "Thank God!" That was all I could get out of him. Pedestrians were walking along the street as usual, shops were open, and the crowd on the street did not seem as restless as it had been yesterday. Overnight, the walls were covered with countless new posters and leaflets against the uprising, addressed to the peasants, to the soldiers on the front, to the workers of Rietsuki Port.

The Revolutionary Committee regime will immediately propose a democratic peace to the peoples, work for peace, guarantee the free transfer of the land of the landlords to the peasant committees, thoroughly democratize the army, establish a system of workers' supervision over production... The Congress decided that all political power in all regions would be transferred to the regional revolutionary committees, which would be responsible for ensuring a genuine revolutionary order. The new Government will take all measures to stabilize the situation, bring about peace and establish democracy. At the same time, Tianquan Jingguang, Senlin Ganyu, General Joongyun, and Shen He, a henchman, attempt to send troops to Riyue Port to overthrow the newly born revolutionary regime. The soldiers, the workers, the clerks, actively rebelled against the three-eyed faeries and the brutal capitalist merchants! Be alert!

They'll all starve to death! It's not supposed to be like this. It's not supposed to be like this! We are a thousand Rocks army, not a treasure gang! Not even a treasure gang could do that! Looking at the military expenses and eating the wages I had taken, I thought again and again, I am afraid I can no longer live with a clear conscience..." "
LYY.10.a:"We're the ones who should kill ourselves..."

LYY.12.t:"Belated Execution"
LYY.12.d:"Jin Long stood in front of the Qianyan Jun Zhien who came to search, his body trembled like a chaff, and his legs trembled. It was Ji-Eun who opened the mouth first:"Jin Long, right?" This sentence in Jin Long's heart was like a thunder, and he could not stand and plop down on his knees:"Army Master spare your life! Military master save your life! I know it was wrong! I'll never do that again! Me to Me to I'll open the warehouse for the grain! I'm giving out all my family's food! Spare my life, soldier!" Zhien gave him a look of disgust, and pressed a list to his face:"This is the illegal income you earned from sitting on the land at the time of the Great famine, a total of 68,04,20 mora. Anything else to say?" Jin Long is still kneeling:"No... That's right... Me to " Before he could finish, Ji-eun waved his hand and called for someone to take him down, dragging a trail of water - he was scared to piss. The next day, amid a chorus of cries and cheers, Jin Ryu and thirty-eight other profiteers were hanged and hung from the gate of the Moon.
LYY.12.a:"I should have died!"

LYY.13.t:"Rock and the Harbor of Contract"
LYY.13.d:"This is Riyue, the most prosperous port in All Tiwat, which has developed under the patronage of the King of Rock for thousands of years, and has a very mature maritime trade route, and the mora from all over the continent flow to here. As the territory of the rock god, it is rich in mineral resources. Riyue Mountain is winding and undulating, and there are many places to build a good pass."
LYY.13.a:"A thousand rocks are firm, and the peaks will not move!"
LYY.14.t:"Strange sense of disharmony"
LYY.14.d:"Qing Qing has no idea how many times this is called by coagulation light in the past, even if the style of coagulation light is quite prejudiced, but there is no dissatisfaction, after all, this is in preparation for" please fairy allenes ", is not a trace of slack. Into the group jade pavilion, the first thing to see is a group of busy and anxious secretaries, carved clear and did not care about these, directly to the coagulation light standing in front of the wall of documents:"Coagulation light?" What did you want to see me for?" Congeing light turned around and pointed to the chair next to it:"Well, you're here, sit down." "Politeness is not necessary, and what kind of work?" "Sure enough, jade Hengxing carved clear, is really direct, for the 'please Sendialli' security issues......" "Don't worry about that. It's all set." "Well, I always have a...... Oh, that's all." Congeal stared out the window and said nothing more.
LYY.14.a:"The calm before the storm?"
LYY.15.t:"The Rock God has Fallen"
LYY.15.d:  "From all the news coming out of the City of Contracts, I am afraid that the most ancient rock god has really fallen. The Chanyan Army has blocked every road from Riyue and banned all trade. No one can enter or leave Riyue at will. No doubt, the economy of Tiat will be greatly affected. I am afraid that all this will continue until there is a result of the investigation into the assassination of the rock God inside the moon."
LYY.15.a:"When is Barbatos' turn?"
LYY.16.t:"Disaster"
LYY.16.d:"Carved clear frown, in a hurry, no one dared to ask what happened, but everyone knows, the king of rock Dijun died in the previous days of the right star condensation of the celestial allenes, I am afraid that jade Heng so nervous only this one thing." "Frozen light!" Carving clear rushed into the group jade Pavilion, found in addition to his other six people have been waiting here for a long time - or, since the emperor's assassination they have not left. Everyone's face is very haggard, it seems that these days are busy, even coagulation light are not the usual calm, eyes revealed a little tired. "Kerqing, you are here, what new news can Qianyan Army have?" "There's been no progress." "We must find a new way!" "Like this, the moon will collapse!" After listening to the report, the following finally could not help but break out. Condensation shook his head, thought for a moment, and said:"

 KQP_the_Peoples_Revolutionary_Committee_idea:"People's Revolutionary Committee"
KQP_the_Peoples_Revolutionary_Committee_idea_desc:"The People's Revolutionary Committee is a new administrative system headed by the Qing dynasty, which abolished the" rule by man "national meritocracy under the previous seven-star system and replaced it with an electoral system. In theory, all citizens have the right to vote, but in practice elections are still largely determined by the extent of local control of the council, the level of popular support, and the popularity of ethnic groups. But on the whole, for the moment the People's Council is sufficiently representative of the masses, even if its functioning is severely riven by this "excessive" democracy.
KQP_thin_domination_idea:"Weak dominance"
KQP_thin_domination_idea_desc:"Although the People's Revolutionary Committee has captured Riyue Port, which is the richest in Riyue and the most convenient for getting support from the Old World, our control of the rest of the country is clearly not optimistic. The Treasure syndicate, the New American terrorists, and even the Slime Chuchu all pose a threat to our rule. Aggressive urbanization in the past has made our relationship with farmers even worse. If we want to get rid of the status quo, we must deal with the terrorists and appease the peasants, otherwise the revolution will never come to an end."

LYY_Harbor_of_Wealth_idea:"The port of Wealth"
Ly_harbor_of_wealth_idea_desc:"§g A ship built for 'circulation' will dock at a port, so Riyue is the place where all wealth 'sinks'. -- Morax §! Liyue, since ancient times has been the capital of commerce, is the "dream factory" in the eyes of countless people, and the King of Rock Dijun will make wise judgments to guide the development of Liyue every year. Xiaoxiao also because of the emperor's "contract" dare not oppress glass month businessmen. Even after the industrial revolution began in Fontaine, Rietsu continued to accumulate wealth with its sheer size and the keen vision of those in power.
LYY_Labor_Dispatch_idea:"Labor Dispatch"
LYY_Labor_Dispatch_idea_desc:"§g We are all begging for a living. We were no longer the strong and enthusiastic children who had left Oruro, but only pale figures. We just want to go home. - Herman Busch Becerra. When the wave of the industrial revolution blew from Fontaine, Riyue quickly embraced it: factories rose up, countless families were dragged out of the fields, and were dragged into the billowing smoke, and Riyue's goods once again sold well in the world. However, Riyue's population alone cannot satisfy the giant beast of capital. It looks abroad, where it still has a vast workforce to conquer. As a result, batches of people set foot on this land for various reasons, and they were either fascinated by the colorful world or simply caught and plundered here. Among them, the largest proportion is the labor dispatch agreement signed between Rietsuki and Celis. In theory, the Agreement is a win-win. Rietsuki gets the labor it needs, and Celis gets a pool of skilled workers after the pact ends, and the remittances from those workers to build the country. But what about the workers? Perhaps only the bones of the no tomb. To tell those stories. Well..."
LYY_Low_Quality_Industry_idea:" Low quality industry"
LYY_Low_Quality_Industry_idea_desc:" It's a pity, although Riyue has been laid out since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution. But so far, Riyue's technology is still not comparable to Fontaine, and it can even be said that Riyue is difficult to independently design new products. The long tradition of the moon is very lack of technical talent, at this point, the moon is not as good as the split and scattered Mund, which has led to Fontaine can arbitrarily collect "patent tax" from the moon, seriously slowing down the progress and speed of industrialization. At the same time, Riyue's policy of encouraging the establishment of factories in the early days led to the emergence of a large number of good and bad products, which also provoked consumer dissatisfaction.
LYY_Crippled_Labor_Laws_idea:" Disability "labor Law"
LYY_Crippled_Labor_Laws_idea_desc:" In the early days, the government strongly encouraged investment. In order to let the capital rest assured, the early moon was completely without the "labor law"! Until last year, as a "jade Hengxing" carved Qing for the first time put forward the "Labor Law" and voted by seven stars, but eventually compromise ended. The negotiated Labor law ostensibly followed the principles of the nine-hour labor law, universal health care, and the prohibition of child labor, but in fact there was no institution to handle labor disputes, and it was derided as the "crippled labor law."

LYY_The_Year_of_Eclipsing_Star:" Year of Heavenly Power"
LYY_The_Year_of_Eclipsing_Star_desc:" The seven stars of the moon have a tradition of taking turns to offer sacrifices to the King of Rock, and with the development of the economy of the moon, this tradition has gradually evolved into the chief sacrifice of the seven stars is acquiesced in having the dominant power of the seven star meeting that year." Last year was "jade Hengxing" carved clear in charge of fairy allusion, known as the year of jade Heng. And this year is the year of Heavenly power, let us wait to see what kind of surprises will be brought to us as the "Heavenly Power Star".

LYY_Appease_the_Public:"Appeasement"
LYY_Appease_the_Public_desc:"The death of the emperor is undoubtedly a huge blow to the Liyue people. Now people in Liyue Port are in panic, and people have begun to hoard daily necessities in preparation for the year of famine. This is not good news for the overall situation of Liyue, we must calm people's anxiety."
LYY_Opening_up_Key_Trade_Routes:"Open key trade routes"
LYY_Opening_up_Key_Trade_Routes_desc:"Our earlier lockdown policy proved to be too harsh. We could have done with a milder lockdown - just cut down the minor roads, and keep a tight watch on the important commercial routes."
LYY_Subsidised_Shops:"Subsidised shops"
Lyy_subsidis_shops_desc:"If I ask the question, what does the moon run on? Morra, no doubt, and Morra runs on merchants. But in the Great Depression and famine years, the "heart" named "Merchant" seems unable to pump Riyuki's Morra blood, what we have to do is a "cardiopulmonary resuscitation" of Riyuki!"
LYY_Military_First:"Military first"
LYY_Military_First_desc:"No army can march to war on an empty stomach, do you think?" Even the Ice Queen's elite, those locust-like fools, even they can't even threaten Mond's children if they're hungry! If we still want the Qianyans to play their role, let's pay them as soon as possible."
LYY_Bring_down_Grain_Prices:"Keep food prices down"
LYY_Bring_down_Grain_Prices_desc:" Well, the carrot subsidy for the merchants has been handed down, the trade routes to Riyue have been opened, and the goods and morra have begun to flow into Riyue, a place where wealth has been deposited. It is time to take out the big stick - to the profaners who are hoarding, Tell them to spit out all the national wealth they have made!"
LYY_Invest_in_the_Crescent:" Investment Crescent"
LYY_Invest_in_the_Crescent_desc:" If we still think about it, Yuetsu's obsession with seafood has kept his costs stable. After all, Rietsu itself is a seaport city, and if they can keep their revenue in the face of such turmoil, then they can keep half of the revenue generated by Rietsu Food."
LYY_Invest_in_Glazed_Pavilion:" Investment Glass Pavilion"
LYY_Invest_in_Glazed_Pavilion_desc:" Most of the mountain treasures in the moon come from the village and flow into the Pavilion. If it is difficult for the Pavilion to continue buying mountain treasures, how can we ensure the income of the residents in the village?" If you don't want to widen the economic gap in Riyue, but also want to ensure that the cost of dining in Hong Kong will not skyrocket, this may be the best choice."
LYY_Invest_in_Wanmintang:" Invest in the People"
LYY_Invest_in_Wanmintang_desc:" This is definitely the most amazing choice we could have made, giving up the two giants of the Glass Pavilion and the Crescent Hall to support the people's Hall. Although the volume of the people Hall is far less than the above two, but it is close to the people and quality in the glass moon catering industry. Forget the two cuisines! If the people don't think they are grounded, then for the sake of stability, let's choose the Temple of the People!"




KQP_Formation_of_the_Peoples_Revolutionary_Committee:"Forma People's Revolutionary Committee"
KQP_Formation_of_the_Peoples_Revolutionary_Committee_desc:"After the assassination of the emperor, Ningguang, with the slogan of" New Deal ", crossed the seven-star system and usurped the supreme power. However, as a "celestial power star", she has been in trouble frequently: not only did not solve the credit crisis brought by the assassination of the emperor, but also provoked unnecessary wars. Facing the tragedy of glass moon, jade Hengxing can no longer tolerate the retrograde application of coagulation light. Launched this revolutionary movement. Now, according to the winter advice. Kirching decided to abolish the old seven-star system and instead set up a People's Revolutionary Committee elected by the people of Riyue Port in order to give full play to the enthusiasm of the masses to voluntarily defend their motherland."
