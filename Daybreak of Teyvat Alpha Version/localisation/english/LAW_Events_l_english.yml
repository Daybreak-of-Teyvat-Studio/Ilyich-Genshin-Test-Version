################劳伦斯事件链########

 LAW.1.t:0 "A bitter beginning"
 LAW.1.d:0 "Tick, tick, tick... As the clock slowly moved on, Yula looked wistfully at the darkened sky, and thought about what she had said to herself in the Order Hall this morning. "Why would you call me a spy for the Winter Kingdom and talk about me as a sinner, when you're the captain of the Guerrilla Knights, protecting the safety of Maunder and Clearspring? I have them all down." Where is my place in the chaos of Mund, though I need to protect a place of peace?"
 LAW.1.a:0 "Uncle Schubert wrote her a letter, inviting her to join in the restoration of the family's glory."
 LAW.1.b:0 "Deluke Legenfeld admired Eula's talent and invited her to dinner. To build new Mond."
 LAW.1.c:0 "The nuns of the West Wind Church held a farewell banquet for Eula. Eula thanked the West Wind Church for her help and went to the West Wind Church to become a nun."


 LAW.2.t:0 "Blessing from wine"
 LAW.2.d:0 " After much thought, she decides to try her luck on her uncle's land. On the way to Daoupa Valley from Mond City, you must pass through Clear Spring, the commercial hub of Mond. You have bought flowers here many times before, but when you visited again, it was cool in autumn. I wanted to have a drink to forget my heart, but because of Diona's ban on alcohol, I had to drink fermented drinks such as bubble sour plum juice. This hatred, I write down. She was still chomping at her drinks when Amber finished her day's patrol and opened the door. Eula couldn't hide the smile on her lips. "How did you... Let me hold a grudge for so long. Amber was about to explain, but she put her finger in front of Amber's lips, motioning for Amber to drink with her. Amber: Hee hee, bartender, have one just like her." The girl smiled and sat in the chair next to Eula, shoving her head into her arms and lovingly acting in her arms."
 LAW.2.a:0 ""You'll come with me to Lord Lawrence," she said, holding Amber in her arms. "Just guarding the place won't keep Mund safe." Amber smiled and agreed."
 LAW.2.b:0 "Amber felt a little wary. 'Yula, aren't even I being accepted?' Unable to speak, she left Clearspring without looking back."

 
 
 LAW.3.t:0 "Dance with me"
 LAW.3.d:0 "After a few rounds, she could not drink any more. She sat languidly on the bar table, her glass shaking in her hand, her chest undulating steadily. Amber whispered in her ear, 'You've had too much to drink, Lara. Let me help you to rest." Eula, muttering about all this unending hatred of you, draped her shoulders over Amber. As the night wore on, Amber looked up at the moon in the sky and at Eula, who was drunk on her back. Amber kissed her tiresome cheek, and Eula smiled a long time ago. \n Amber's cabin in Clear Spring wasn't quite as spacious as the Order's dormitory, but it was very much Amber's personal touch. When Amber was put to bed, she lay on top of her, and the blue and red color palette looked like an exquisite painting. The morning sun through the glass, sprinkled on the ground and bed, two people tightly embrace each other, scattered skirt and pants, just like the flower of life in full bloom."
 LAW.3.a:0 "Eula is like a sister being cared for by her sister, and there's nothing to stop her now"

 
 LAW.4.t:0 "Ice and spray dance"
 LAW.4.d:0 "Eula pointed to the castle on the mountainside. "Amber, that's where Lawrence controls it. Are you really ready?" Amber nodded, her red eyes firm. Above the magnificently decorated hall, Schubert sat silent on his throne, looking down at Yula below him. "How ridiculous that you, traitor of Lawrence, have abandoned your high status and fallen to hang out with a pariah of the Order, and now come back like a lost dog! You have insulted the name Lawrence. You have no place in our glorious family!" Eula was wronged, but she couldn't look weak: "If Eula was a traitor, then why was your uncle clean? You've done nothing for your family, but you've squanded generations of family savings. When will we reunite Maunder once again?" Schubert was a little surprised, but his look was not half askance: "Oh? She seems to have Lawrence's demeanor, but who is that next to you, your prisoner?" Seeing that Schubert was about to turn on Amber, Eula interrupted again. "Watch your words! She is my adjutant - Amber, with the noble blood of the moon. And a good sounding board, and Lawrence will no longer fear the Order's rabble." Schubert could no longer hide his smile and stood up from his throne. "Very well, then, I will give you another chance to cleanse yourself of your sin instead of dishonor me." "
 LAW.4.a:0 "This hatred, I will not forget."
 LAW.4.b:0 "The descendants of sinners are no longer for me. I'm just Eula."

 
 LAW.5.t:0 "Hard ice never melts"
 LAW.5.d:0 "The corners of Schubert's mouth rose high as he looked at the huge lion's head hanging from the throne in the hall. Behind him stood a man of foreign appearance, with a black hood, whose face could not be seen clearly, and only his red eyes were shining. \n "The training of a new batch of equipment and personnel has been roughly completed, awaiting his Highness's further plans." "Very well, my dear Sergei. It seems it's time." \n "We shall bask in the glory of our ancestral kingdom when it returns to earth.""
 LAW.5.a:0 "Good!"

 
 LAW.6.t:0 "The spray will shatter the hard ice"
 LAW.6.d:0 "The next day, she was awakened by a familiar piece of music. Although yesterday's meeting with Schubert was depressing, Amber was there for her. As she pushed the window OPEN, she was transFIXED -- a DOZEN dancers dressed AS LEI Ying WarLOCKS were in the courtyard, moving skillFULLY to the beat of the music in a MOVE THAT she was unlikely to forget. The ritual used by famous families to show their nobility is known as the most shining pearl on the top of the scepter - the ritual dance. Amber saw something strange in this defiance of Mond's tradition. To Eula:"
 LAW.6.a:0 "Yula, how could you lose to these foreigners? You should correct them to jump together."
 LAW.6.b:0 "Eula, you were right. Hopefully this will protect Mond."

 
 LAW.7.t:0 "The Owl and the Rose"
 LAW.7.d:0 "Eula, who used to read the Steambird newspaper, was now under virtual house arrest in the castle, her only chance of contact with the outside world. She read the whole newspaper carefully to make sure she didn't miss any information between the lines. There is nothing worth noting. Disappointed, she closed the newspaper and laid it casually on the dresser. \n There was another place, Eula suddenly remembered, the crossword. According to the prompts, put the correct words on the correct grid. \n It was not difficult for Eula, who had a high aristocratic education. She quickly filled in each word on the grid, flawless. When she saw the message hidden in the words, she smiled. \ nNOCTUA \nTEMPUS FUGIT hourglass"
 LAW.7.a:0 "We are no longer alone"

 
 LAW.8.t:0 "Let's face the enemy"
 LAW.8.d:0 "The patriarch's clock leaves a fable that everything should be done first. Eula knew it would be hard to root out her uncle and the fools with her weak power. In addition to relying on her aristocratic status, she went to military places and knew the situation of the fools' troops. Amber is also allowed to use her prideful detective skills to probe into the secrets of the Lawrence Army that Yula has not yet known, so that she can prepare for the coup."
 LAW.8.a:0 "Know yourself and know your enemy, and never lose a hundred battles"

 
 LAW.9.t:0 "Count Rabbit, strike!"
 LAW.9.d:0 "Lara and Amber's intelligence investigation is successful, and the fools' every move is gradually revealed under their prying eyes. The biggest uncertainty about the coup has been completely ruled out."
 LAW.9.a:0 "What matters is not the wind but the courage"
 LAW.9.b:0 ""
 LAW.9.c:0 ""
 
 LAW.10.t:0 "This time... Miss the mark"
 LAW.10.d:0 "True hunters often appear in the form of prey, and when Amber is returning from a reconnaissance mission, she is seen clearly by Sergei in the shadows. Just when she thought she was out of the investigation, a great force lifted her up, and a foreign voice whispered in her ear, "Found you, peeping..." A chill like never before went down Amber's back."
 LAW.10.a:0 "Amber, where are you?"
 LAW.10.b:0 ""
 LAW.10.c:0 ""
 
 LAW.11.t:0 "Wind into the tower"
 LAW.11.d:0 "Amber opened her eyes. She was in the cold basement, shackled in a chair, unable to move. She tried to break free, but an electric current went through her body and made her want to scream. But he found that his mouth was stuffed with a mouth ball, and he could only make a "whimpering" sound. \n "Don't try to scream, it's no use." Out of the darkness came a warlock, Thunder Ying, who trod small steps to reach Amber. "White mouse, let's do something fun!" Amber's heart went cold. In this place where the sky should not be called, no one will know their existence, let alone save themselves. She was not afraid of death; it had been her destiny from her first days as a knight. Her only concern, however, was for Eula's safety. \n "Will be a little pain oh ~" Lei Ying sorcerer evil spirit smile, pressed a button. \n "Woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-woo-WW!!" A much stronger current whipped Amber's body. Every bone is suffering. She felt she was going to lose consciousness. Fortunately, this hellish experience soon ended. Leying, the Warlock, came and plunged a needle into Amber's body. Then she removed the mouseball, which was full of saliva. \n "Now, speak. Tell everything you know." Amber's mind was reeling and her consciousness began to drift. She knew it was the effect of the confessionals. She knows how to deal with this thing, she can't give in, and then she needs to believe the story she's going to tell, make it believable... \n Or, just a little more credibly."
 LAW.11.a:0 "The distressed end, will there be a turnaround?"
 LAW.11.b:0 ""
 LAW.11.c:0 ""

 LAW.12.t:0 "The wind said -- it was time to fly"
 LAW.12.d:0 ""Almost." After hours of interrogation, Warlock Lei Ying nodded with satisfaction as Amber, flushed and with red hearts in her pupils, looked on. "Sweet dreams, white mouse." Then he told another Leying warlock, "Keep an eye on her, and don't let her break free." The iron door clanged shut, leaving only Amber and the other warlock, Thunder Ying, in the basement. Amber was put back on her mouth ball. Her clothes had been reduced to rags by the current, barely covering her, and even so, every inch was soaked with transparent liquid. Tears wet her face, love to laugh she had never felt so bad. The effects of the confide still tormented her body, and she felt a fever and numbness in her lower limbs. Amber had forgotten what she had said. There was only one thought on her mind. \n The warlock, Lei Ying, noticed something different about Amber and asked, "Are you feeling a little sick? Shall I get you some water?" Amber wriggled for relief, but didn't want it any more. "I'm Katharina," the Warlock said to Amber. "Don't get excited. I have the antidote to Confession." Amber said in a trembling voice, 'You... Why did you save me? I... I feel bad now." Katharina looked at the guards approaching behind the door and whispered in Amber's ear, 'Because that's what I should do.' \n Another needle plunged into Amber's left hand. Unlike those terrible drugs, she could clearly feel the tingling and heat dissipating. After a while, she returned to normal. \n The shackles that had bound Amber's limbs were unshackled. She tried to get up from her chair at once, but she found that she could not help herself at all. She lay limp on it like a lump of mud. "Don't move, I will help you." The sorcerer gently picked up the girl and slowly walked out. "Close your eyes. You're a corpse now." Powerless, Amber had no choice but to give her all to the sorcerer, Thunder Ying, whose name was Catalina. When sight was out of use, the other senses were acutely sensitive. The faint scent of Caterina, the ethereal voice, reminded Amber of Eula. If only she had been holding me... \n "Here we are." Caterina stopped at last, and they reached the top of the tower, where the wind could be seen clearly. She handed Amber a wind-wing and asked, 'Can you use it?'"
 LAW.12.a:0 "I'm the flying champion of Mund City"
 LAW.12.b:0 ""
 LAW.99.c:0 ""


 LAW.13.t:0 "A misunderstood story"
 LAW.13.d:0 "She was pacing up and down the room. She hadn't heard from Amber for days. She looked at herself in the mirror and startled. She didn't recognize her face any more: the bags under her eyes, the bloodshot eyes, the haggard look. As she wondered what to do if Amber didn't return, Schubert opened the door with a bang. He grabbed her by the neck and shouted, "You said that woman was a noble blood from Ragmoon, you said she was a key figure in our defeat of the Order, and look what you've done in the months you've been here! You've done nothing but trouble me! Now that woman has confessed that she is a secret agent sent by the Order!" Schubert's face grew grim as he continued, "Honestly, Lara, as the eldest daughter of the Lawrence family, I now suspect that you are here to steal the family, too. How on earth am I supposed to believe you?" Eula was left stunned with a look of disbelief. \n The next moment, Yula could stand it no longer. "Order, order, order! Can I join the order so that you don't even care about your family? ? With a sudden force, she pushed Schubert away and stormed out. \n "Quick, get her back!" Schubert fought the pain and shouted to his attendants. Several guards ran in the direction of Yula's departure. "I'm a knight. I'm supposed to guard whom I want to guard!" Yula shouted. Then she ran to the roof, where guards surrounded her several times. The close-quarters combat she had learned in the Order made her difficult to approach. One of the guard captain Daryl said: "such a persistent young lady, she must have an unshakable power in her heart." As she approached the rooftop, she noticed a wind-wing flying in the night sky far beyond the window, and she knew Amber had escaped. Calmly leaning on the wall and pretending to be exhausted, he said to the guards behind him, "Come on, I am already in your pocket. Take me and get the reward!""
 LAW.13.a:0 "I'm still your knight"
 LAW.13.b:0 "Hard ***** ice, ***** revenge"
 LAW.13.c:0 ""


 LAW.14.t:0 "Frost for resentment"
 LAW.14.d:0 "Perhaps Eula had not yet made a bad impact, or perhaps Schubert's conscience was still alive. Her imprisonment did not last long, and Schubert promised to throw her a birthday party. Although she wouldn't put the hatred away in her heart, she agreed on the surface. She opened her dressing-box, and there lay quietly a small palm-gun. This weapon, originally used for female self-defense, will now help Yula put an end to the hate of all hate. \n "Where shall I put it?" Eula was troubled. Her dress had no hidden pockets to fit into. But soon, she had an answer. Yula took the pistol and hid it in her proud twin peaks. In two separate directions, parts of the guerrilla squad and the reconnaissance squad met once more on the Windswept land, not to expel Lawrence from Maunder, but to cleanse him of his crimes. Amber looked across the valley and said, 'That's Schubert's lair over there. May the wind protect us.' With an updraft, the knights disappeared into the sky. On the watchtower of the castle, servants come and go, and the tables are set with delicate cutlery. When the lights are on, the tower lights can be as far as five kilometers away. Eula and Schubert had dinner looking out into the distance at the city of Monde. Schubert raised his glass to the distant city of Mond and said, "Our army has recovered its strength. In less than a year, we can have a Windflower festival there!" \n "Forget it, you won't even survive the night." She thought, forcing a smile on her face. Schubert repeatedly talked about how excellent Eula was, who was not part of the Order, and how the Order had lied to the Maunds by duplicating what they said, so much so that Eula took her hand and said that your uncle had always had a place for you. Under the influence of the melodizing music and alcohol, Schubert closed his eyes and leaned back against the recliner. You know, this is your chance. "How can you unite Mond with vermin like you!" She pulled the pistol out of the ditch and, as her uncle looked on in amazement, hit him precisely in the chest. Schubert could not say anything, he only saw the black muzzle of the gun pointed at his head. \n "Goodbye, Lawrence" \n bang --"
 LAW.14.a:0 "This hatred, don't remember."
 LAW.14.b:0 ""
 LAW.14.c:0 ""


 LAW.15.t:0 "Melt the frost with love"
 LAW.15.d:0 "Almost at the same moment, more than a dozen scout knights descended from the top of the watchtower, their submachine guns pouring bullets into everything in sight. When the smoke cleared, the magnificent table was a mess, the floor covered with brass casings, and the bloody smell of the servants mingled with the mellow smell of the fine wine. Eula stepped carefully over the debris on the floor so as not to stain her dress. She went up to the girl in the red headscarf, bowed her head, and kissed her on the lips. For a long time, lips, two people left a crystal silver wire. They hugged each other so tightly that Amber felt a little moisture on her shoulders. She turned her head away. A tear was hanging from the corner of her eye. Amber gently wiped away her tears and said in her ear, "Laura, I'm back.""
 LAW.15.a:0 "Well, welcome back"
 LAW.15.b:0 ""
 LAW.15.c:0 ""


 LAW.16.t:0 "Blood-stained bone sentinel"
 LAW.16.d:0 "The joy of the reunion did not last long. \n "You Laurance traitors, stay still. I'll send you up one by one!" A deep voice suddenly sounded in the air, causing alarm bells to go off in everyone's heart. The knights surrounded Amber and Yula, protecting their leader. Want to escape?" The voice came out of thin air again, and a shadow came hurtling toward Amber at great speed. Be careful!" Eula tried to stop her first, but it was too late. Amber closed her eyes in despair. Purple figures flashed by. \n The next moment, however, the imagined pain did not occur. \n "Whoo!" Katerina, who had been following the knights, fell to the ground, blood gushing from a long gash in her back. Amber immediately pulled off a corner of her dress and tried to stop the bleeding. Caterina's face was white and weaker, and she mumbled, 'I... I don't want to die." Amber said reassuringly. 'Don't worry... It's okay... Medic!" \n The moment Catarina was struck, the assassin was also stained with her blood, and a glint of red in the air revealed his position. Yula snatched the knight's submachine gun and fired it at the red. With a cry of pain, the foreign man named Sergei showed himself, and all the guns were aimed at him. \n "Any last words?" Yula held the smoldering muzzle of the gun against his head. "Long Live the Queen" He broke the capsule between his teeth and frothed at once. He's dead."
 LAW.16.a:0 ""Tut... He got the better of him.""
 LAW.16.b:0 ""
 LAW.16.c:0 ""


 LAW.17.t:0 "Left hand right hand"
 LAW.17.d:0 "Eula had her makeup adjusted so she didn't look like she'd been through a bloody incident. She chose Resu Square in Dadaupa Valley, a necessary stopover between the port of Liyue and the Port of Jingfu. On the way there, she repeatedly checked with Amber whether she was mentally healthy to ensure that she would not talk, until she saw the morning sun appear on the horizon, she remembered the beautiful night with Amber in Clear Spring Town, and steadied her mind... "Men of Lawrence, travellers to and fro, and guards on patrol, please stop for a moment from what you are doing, and hear me out. Ice is to eliminate the burning pain and have a calm heart; Fire is to dispel the fear of cold and love the heart of life. Schubert Lawrence will be a family of people because of the purity of blood is separated forever, the inner selfish greed daubed on the gold foil to restore Mond. I, Eula, do not want to see and cannot allow people to continue to endure this torturing and meaningless cause. To tell the truth, I do not want to divide any man, whether he was born in wealth or poverty, whether he came from Mund or foreign lands. Mund is riddled with Lawrence's SINS and needs our help to save him; Instead of fighting against each other and destroying lives. The old precepts of the patriarchs taught that nobles should be courteous and not haughty; But Lawrence has lost his way, blinded his soul by his greed for power, and forced innocent people to kill each other for the gold on their seats. We have improved our roads but used them to send troops; we have enriched our knowledge but become indifferent and cunning. Isolation from the outside world becomes closed and arrogant. What we need is a prosperous trade route, not a closed one; What is needed is kindness and warmth, not coldness and dexterity. Without these, our SINS will never go away. Millions of people around the world hear my voice right now -- millions of desperate men, women, and children, victims of the same system that tormented people and put innocent people in prison. I say to those who hear my voice, "Do not despair." What we suffer now is only the bitterness and wantonly greed of those who fear human progress before they die. The hatred of these men will vanish, the decadent aristocracy will fall, and the power they have taken from the people will be restored to the people. Man shall die, and freedom shall never end." After she said her last words, she held out her left hand for a response. There was complete silence. Everyone felt that Eula was different from those who had been talking about nobility and restoration, and no one could predict what would happen next. Amber crooned, "When the going gets tough, raise your left hand..." Until this time, some people suddenly realized, handed out their right hand; There were stunned people, and then there were those who went through tears and said, "The real Lawrence is back..." Amber raised her voice. 'The left hand is a sign of direction and doesn't bow in the face of difficulties...' Then she jumped onto the stage with her hands clasped together, her water-blue hair and flaming red ribbon visible in the sunlight."
