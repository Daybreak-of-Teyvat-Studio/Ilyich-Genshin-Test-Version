 Teyvat_News.63.d:0 "When in the Course of human events, it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bonds which have connected them with another, and to assume among the Powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We, therefore, the Representatives of Sumeru Desert, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these provinces, solemnly publish and declare, That these United Provinces are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States."

Teyvat.2.d:0 "According to legend, after the Demon War, human civilization was slowly revived under the protection of God, and the God established the Sky Island. On the sky island, there was a god named Tianli, who was the supreme ruler of the Tiwati continent over the seven earthly powers. When the Twins wanted to leave Tiwat 500 years ago, it was nature that stopped them. She sealed the arrogation of the Son of Man, and led the seven gods and armies of Tiwat to destroy the land of miracles -- Kanya. Now, she will blow the horn of war, vowed to clean the dust of the world. Faced with the challenge of nature, our dear Fourth Scourge is likely to become the enemy of Nature, and of course it may become the guide of Nature. In this conference, challenges and opportunities coexist, please make your choice!"
