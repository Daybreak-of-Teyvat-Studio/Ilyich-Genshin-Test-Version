 Book_script_The_Traveler:0 "\nIt is said that in ancient times, the Seven Dragon Kings were evil in Teyvat, and then the Eternal Throne came to earth. The Original Man created the continent and made the Three Moon Goddesses take turns as monarchs. In the Flame Era, the world was in chaos, and the Demons arose. Gradually, Seven Gods returned to their thrones, and established many kingdoms of Mondstadt, Liyue, Inazuma and so on. A few thousand years later, Teyvat was hit by the Khaenri'ahn War. After the resting of five hundred years, to this day, the clouds in the sky have beening changing and the great war is about to appear!"
